# MongoDB

MongoDB is a first-class driver, not a bolt-on: the same explorer, grid, tabs
and MCP connector serve it. But it is the one engine with no SQL, so several
surfaces work differently, and a few SQL-only ones don't exist there at all.
This page is what changes.

## Connecting

The connection dialog is field-driven (host, port, database, username, **Auth
source**) and builds the `mongodb://` URI live from what you type. The password
is stored in the OS keychain and is *not* embedded in the URI.

**Edit connection string** unlocks the URI for what the form can't express:
Atlas (`mongodb+srv://…`), replica sets, and any extra URI option. Once you
edit it by hand, that string is what gets used verbatim — the discrete fields
become best-effort conveniences.

Two limits worth knowing up front:

- **SSH tunnelling works for `mongodb://host:port`, not for
  `mongodb+srv://`.** An SRV record resolves to several replica-set hosts and
  one tunnel can only front one of them.
- Leaving the database blank is fine: the connection opens at cluster level and
  the explorer lists the databases. Collections live under each database node.

## Browsing

Databases → collections → fields and indexes, same tree as everywhere else. The
field list is **inferred** from a sample of documents, because a collection has
no declared schema; it is a reading aid, not a contract, and a field only some
documents carry is still shown.

Collection sizes and index sizes/usage come from `$collStats` and `$indexStats`
and are **best-effort**: a role without the privilege leaves the column out
entirely rather than showing zeros that would read as "unused".

## The query editor speaks `mongosh`, in a bounded dialect

The editor takes shell syntax, not SQL:

```js
db.orders.find({ status: "open", total: { $gt: 100 } }).sort({ createdAt: -1 }).limit(50)
```

- **Read methods**: `find`, `findOne`, `aggregate`, `countDocuments` (`count`),
  `distinct`.
- **Write methods**: `insertOne`, `insertMany`, `updateOne`, `updateMany`,
  `replaceOne`, `deleteOne`, `deleteMany`.
- **Schema methods** (since 1.19.0): `createIndex({field: -1}, {unique: true})`,
  `dropIndex("name")`, `hideIndex("name")` / `unhideIndex("name")`, `drop()`,
  and `renameCollection("newName")`. The rename stays **within the current
  database** — the form `mongosh` accepts too; a cross-database *move* is the
  explorer's Rename dialog (see below), deliberately not the grammar's, because
  a collection name may itself contain dots (`system.views`, `logs.2024`) and
  reading `renameCollection("logs.2024")` as "move to the database `logs`"
  would be silently wrong. `renameCollection` never drops an existing
  destination: a collision is an error, and passing `dropTarget: true` is
  refused. Over MCP these need the connection's write policy at `full`; the same
  operations are also available from the index manager and the explorer's
  context menus.
- **Chained modifiers**: `.sort({…})`, `.limit(n)`, `.skip(n)`,
  `.projection({…})`.
- **Relaxed JSON**: unquoted keys, single quotes, trailing commas, `//` and
  `/* */` comments.
- **BSON constructors**: `ObjectId(…)`, `ISODate(…)` / `new Date(…)`,
  `NumberLong/Int/Double/Decimal(…)`.

It is deliberately **not** a JavaScript engine. There are no variables, no
expressions, no `for` loops. Anything outside the grammar — an unknown method, a
JS expression — is refused with a clear error rather than half-parsed into
something that runs. Still open on the roadmap: `explain`, `bulkWrite`,
`findAndModify`, change streams, GridFS.

## Editing documents

The grid's **List view** turns into a document editor for MongoDB: nested values
fold, each field edits in place, and there are affordances a SQL row doesn't
need — add a field (`$set`), delete a field (`$unset`), and a **BSON type
picker**.

Three things about it are deliberate:

- **A field is addressed by its path** (`customData.format`, `tags.2`), not by
  its position in the display. Filtering or sorting the view can't misdirect a
  write.
- **Edits keep the server's type.** The display is lossy on purpose — `Int32`,
  `Int64` and `Double` all arrive as plain JSON numbers, `ObjectId`, `Date` and
  `Decimal128` all as strings — so the type is carried alongside each value
  rather than guessed from it. Fixing a typo in a `NumberLong` writes a
  `NumberLong` back, not an `Int32` that happens to fit. Use the type picker
  when you actually *want* to change a field's type.
- **Values whose display form can't be parsed back are not editable inline**:
  `Binary`, `DbPointer`, `MinKey`, `MaxKey`. The grid shows
  `Binary(Generic, 12 bytes)`, and committing that text is not a thing anyone
  wants. The type picker is their escape hatch — it writes a fresh value of the
  chosen type.

One limit: **a field's key cannot be renamed in place**. A rename is a `$set` of
the new key plus an `$unset` of the old one, and doing that safely needs one
atomic document-level update rather than the per-field writes this view uses.

## Aggregation pipelines and views

A MongoDB view *is* a stored aggregation pipeline, so there is no separate view
editor: **New aggregation…** on a collection and **Edit pipeline…** on a view
open the same surface.

- **Stages** mode gives one card per stage: pick the operator, write the body,
  drag to reorder, and toggle a stage off without deleting it. **Text** mode is
  the whole pipeline as one array. Switching modes requires the pipeline to
  parse, and text mode has nowhere to keep a disabled stage — you get told
  before it's dropped.
- The **preview** runs as you type, on a debounce, over a bounded sample (the
  **Sample** control), and each stage card shows what *its* prefix of the
  pipeline emitted. So you see where a stage stopped matching, not just the
  final output.
- **`$out` and `$merge` are refused**, in previews and in saved views alike. The
  preview runs while you type; a write stage would overwrite a real collection
  mid-edit.
- **Save as view…** stores the pipeline as a view (`create`), and re-saving an
  open view updates it (`collMod`). Preview output is read-only — a computed
  document has no `_id` to write back through.
- Pipeline text is parsed by the same parser the query editor uses, so
  `ObjectId(…)` in a `$match` stays an `ObjectId` on the round trip. Opening a
  view and saving it unchanged does not quietly stop it matching anything.
  Types with no constructor in the grammar (`Binary`, `Timestamp`, `MinKey`,
  `MaxKey`) fall back to Extended JSON — the documented lossy edge.

## Indexes

**Indexes…** on a collection opens a dedicated index manager. MongoDB is the
only driver with one, and not because the others lack indexes: theirs live
inside the structure editor, diffed into `CREATE INDEX` / `DROP INDEX` along
with the rest of the table. MongoDB has no DDL to diff.

- The list is read from the raw `listIndexes` reply, so **everything survives a
  round trip**: per-key direction (`1` / `-1`) and type (`text`, `2dsphere`,
  `hashed`), `unique`, `sparse`, TTL (`expireAfterSeconds`),
  `partialFilterExpression`, `collation`, `weights`, `hidden` — and anything not
  modelled explicitly is kept as source text. Rebuilding `{ createdAt: -1 }`
  from a list of field names would recreate it *ascending*: invisible in
  testing, permanent in the data.
- An index whose keys the picker can't express opens in **raw** mode instead of
  being flattened into something it can show.
- **Edit is drop + create.** MongoDB can't alter an index in place, so the new
  spec is parsed and validated *before* the old one is dropped, and the
  confirmation says the collection runs without that index while the new one
  builds.
- **Hide** is the reversible rehearsal for **Drop**: a hidden index is kept up
  to date but ignored by the planner, so you can measure what dropping it would
  cost and undo it instantly. That is why it sits next to Drop in the menu.
- `_id_` can't be edited, hidden or dropped — the server owns it, and the
  backend refuses it rather than only greying out the button.
- **Size** and **Uses** are best-effort, as above.
- Index writes are **not** exposed over the MCP connector.

## Renaming and moving a collection

**Rename…** works on collections (`renameCollection` on the `admin` database),
which is also how a collection *moves*: rename it to `otherDb.name` and the
documents are copied server-side. That takes as long as the collection is big
and needs privileges on both databases, so the dialog says so. Renaming onto an
existing collection errors rather than dropping it.

A cross-database move **closes the collection's open tabs** instead of
retitling them: the destination sits behind a different connection node, and a
retitled tab would keep querying the database the collection just left.

A **view** can't be renamed — recreate it under the new name.

## What isn't there (and why)

| Surface | State |
| --- | --- |
| Structure editor (`ALTER TABLE`-style) | Not applicable. There is no schema to alter; fields are created by writing them. Structure is read-only, indexes have their own manager. |
| `.sql` export / import | Not applicable. A collection exports and imports as **JSON** instead (**Export collection (JSON)…** in its context menu). |
| `$jsonSchema` validator editor | Open on the roadmap. Read/write a collection's validator via `collMod`. |
| Multi-document transactions | Open. Needs an explicit `ClientSession` threaded through the CRUD helpers; a replica set is required server-side. |
| Typed `_id` round-trip | Open. A 24-hex-character `_id` is treated as an `ObjectId`; a genuine 24-hex *string* `_id` is the one ambiguous case. |
| `explain` | Open. The aggregation editor previews output but shows no query plan. |
| `mongodb+srv://` through an SSH tunnel | Open. See "Connecting" above. |

`docs/MONGODB_ROADMAP.md` tracks the full done/deferred split with the
implementation hooks for each.

## Over MCP

Every read tool works against MongoDB: `list_databases`, `list_tables`
(collections), `describe_table`, `list_indexes`, `browse_table`, and `run_query`
with the same `mongosh` grammar (reads are `find` / `aggregate` /
`countDocuments` / `distinct`). The write tools work too, gated by the same
per-connection write policy as the SQL drivers. On a connection with no
database bound, pass `schema` — the database name — or the collection list comes
back empty. See [`MCP.md`](MCP.md).

`create_index` and `drop_index` are MongoDB-only tools — on the SQL drivers an
index is created with `CREATE INDEX` through `run_write`, which is more
expressive than any portable form. Read the existing indexes with
`list_indexes` first: on MongoDB each entry carries a `mongo` object with the
real definition, and the column list alone cannot tell `{createdAt: -1}` from
`{createdAt: 1}`.
