# Canary channel

The **canary** channel lets you dogfood an in-progress change against your
real production connection profiles **before** promoting it to a stable
release — without cutting a full release and without any risk to the state of
your installed stable app.

A canary build is a completely separate application that installs and runs
**side-by-side** with the stable HuginnDB:

| | Stable | Canary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Product name | HuginnDB | HuginnDB Canary |
| Bundle identifier | `io.huginndb.app` | `io.huginndb.canary` |
| On-disk state dir | `<config>/HuginnDB` | `<config>/HuginnDB-Canary` |
| Updater feed | `releases/latest/…/latest.json` | `releases/download/canary/latest.json` |
| OS keychain service | `io.huginndb.app` | `io.huginndb.app` *(shared)* |

Two deliberate design choices make this work:

- **State is isolated.** The `canary` Cargo feature switches
  `crate::app_identity::APP_DIR` to `HuginnDB-Canary`, so every state file
  (`profiles.json`, `prefs.json`, `tab_state.json`, `known_hosts.json`, the MCP
  audit log) lives in its own directory. A change that performs a destructive,
  one-way on-disk migration (e.g. the tab-state v2→v3 migration) can be
  exercised in the canary without ever touching your production state.
- **Credentials are shared.** The OS keychain service is *not* build-aware
  (see `src-tauri/src/keychain.rs`). The canary reads the passwords the stable
  build already stored, so you can test against production profiles without
  re-entering anything. The canary only ever *writes* to the keychain if you
  explicitly add, edit, or remove a profile from inside it.

> The canary starts with an empty profile list (its state dir is separate). To
> point it at your production profiles, copy `profiles.json` from the stable
> config dir into the `HuginnDB-Canary` dir — the passwords resolve from the
> shared keychain automatically, no secrets are copied. (A one-click import is
> a natural follow-up; not built yet.)

## How it fits into git

You do **not** cut a release tag for a canary. The whole point is to build from
work that isn't released yet.

1. Your change lives on a branch (feature branch or your development branch).
   `main` and the stable release tags are untouched.
2. You trigger the **canary** workflow against that branch (see below). It
   builds from the exact branch/commit you pick — no tag required.
3. When you're happy with it, you promote normally: merge the branch to `main`,
   bump the version in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, and push a `vX.Y.Z` tag. The
   stable `release` workflow then publishes the real release to the stable
   updater feed. The canary was only the rehearsal.

### Worked example — testing a 1.10.1 candidate while 1.10.0 is in production

```
# work on the change
git switch -c feature/big-change
# … commits …
git push -u origin feature/big-change
```

Then in the GitHub UI: **Actions → canary → Run workflow**, and set:

- **Use workflow from**: `feature/big-change` (or leave `ref` empty and it
  builds the branch you selected here)
- **version**: `1.10.1`

The build is stamped `1.10.1-canary.<run_number>` (e.g. `1.10.1-canary.7`). The
prerelease suffix sorts *below* the eventual stable `1.10.1`, so a canary never
outranks a real release. Each run bumps `<run_number>`, so the canary updater
always sees a newer version and offers the update.

Iterate as many times as you like (each push → new canary run → new
`-canary.N`). When it's solid:

```
git switch main && git merge feature/big-change
# bump "version" to 1.10.1 in src-tauri/tauri.conf.json, commit
git tag v1.10.1 && git push origin main v1.10.1
```

## How it runs on your machine

1. **Install HuginnDB Canary once.** Download the installer from the rolling
   [`canary` release](https://github.com/Alexfp28/huginnDB/releases/tag/canary)
   and install it. It won't disturb your stable install.
2. **After that, it auto-updates on its own channel.** Every canary build you
   publish replaces the rolling `canary` release, so the canary app detects the
   new `-canary.N` version on next launch and offers to install it — exactly
   like the stable updater, but isolated to the canary channel.
3. Point it at your production profiles (see the note above) and test away.

## Building locally

You can also build a canary bundle without CI:

```powershell
pnpm tauri build --config src-tauri/tauri.canary.conf.json --features canary
```

Or just run a canary-flavoured dev shell (isolated state dir, no separate
updater):

```powershell
pnpm tauri dev --features canary
```

## Notes / limitations

- The workflow builds **Windows** only (matching the stable release matrix).
  Add platforms to `.github/workflows/canary.yml`'s matrix if you need them.
- Canary artifacts are signed with the **same** updater keypair as stable
  (`TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY`), so they verify with the public key already in
  `tauri.conf.json` (inherited by the canary config).
- The bundled `huginndb-mcp` sidecar is built *stable* (not with the `canary`
  feature), so if you use the MCP connector from a canary install its audit log
  goes to the stable `HuginnDB` dir. This is cosmetic — the audit log isn't
  state that migrations corrupt — and avoids a feature-passthrough in the
  sibling `mcp-server` crate. Split it if that ever matters.
