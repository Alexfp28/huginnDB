//! Query execution and table-data commands.
//!
//! Entry points:
//!
//! * [`execute_query`]   — run an arbitrary SQL statement provided by the
//!   user. Branches between fetch and execute depending on whether the
//!   statement looks read-only.
//! * [`fetch_table_data`] — paginated SELECT over a known table, with
//!   optional sort + column filters. Backs the table-data browser tab.
//! * [`update_cell`]     — UPDATE one column of one row by primary key.
//!   Drives inline / cell-editor edits in the grid.
//! * [`delete_rows`]     — DELETE one or more rows addressed by primary key.
//! * [`insert_row`]      — INSERT one row from a list of column/value pairs.
//!   Used by both the "insert" and "duplicate" flows in the grid.
