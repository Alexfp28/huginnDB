/// Import an environment export: every bundle in the file becomes a **new**
/// environment — none is ever merged into or overwritten on top of one that
/// already exists, which is what makes this safe to run repeatedly and what
/// guarantees the origins/cosmetics below never collide with anything already
/// configured. The only real conflict surface is the shared connection-profile
/// pool (`profiles.json` is global), resolved once for the whole file via
/// `apply_profile_imports` — not once per environment.
///
/// Each new environment's connection-tree is scoped to exactly the profiles
/// its bundle referenced via `launch.visible_connections` (the same
/// DataGrip-style filter #107 already added), translated through the
/// import's original-id → new-id map so a skipped or renamed profile is
/// reflected correctly. None are auto-connected (`launch.active_connections`
/// stays empty): importing an environment should not silently open N live
/// database connections.
///
/// Each origin is registered — globally, in `PersistedTabState::origins`, not
/// on the new environment (there is no per-environment slot any more, see
/// `commands::origins`'s module doc) — with a fresh id and no stored
/// passphrase. An encrypted one surfaces the same "no passphrase stored"
/// state a freshly `add_origin`-ed one would, on the next sync — there's
/// nothing special to resolve here at import time. No dedup against origins
/// already registered from a previous import: unlike the v4→v5 migration
/// (which merges by necessity, since a v4 blob could genuinely hold the same
/// path twice), a fresh import minting a second global entry for a path
/// that's already registered is a much rarer case and easy to spot and clean
/// up by hand in Settings → Origins.
///
/// `async fn` on purpose, with the actual work run via `spawn_blocking`: a
/// synchronous Tauri command executes on the main thread, and
/// `apply_profile_imports` runs one 600 000-iteration PBKDF2 derivation per
/// encrypted secret (`transfer::decrypt_secret`) — deliberately slow, and with
/// a bundle carrying dozens of environments' worth of connection profiles,
/// slow enough in aggregate to freeze the window for the whole import (issue:
/// app reported "not responding" importing 13 environments / 22 conflicting
/// profiles).
///
/// `window` is only used to scope [`IMPORT_PROGRESS_EVENT`] to the caller —
/// see the event's own doc comment (`commands::connection`) for why a plain
/// `app.emit` would leak progress into every open window (CLAUDE.md gotcha #25).
