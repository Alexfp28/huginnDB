//! MongoDB index-manager commands.
//!
//! The Mongo counterpart of what [`crate::commands::structure`] does for the
//! SQL drivers, and split out for the same reason
//! [`crate::commands::aggregation`] is: there is nothing here to diff into DDL.
//! An index is created, hidden, replaced or dropped through a run-command, and
//! `apply_structure_change` rejects MongoDB outright.
//!
//! Two conventions carry over from the aggregation editor and matter:
//!
//! * **Documents cross as source text.** Index keys, partial filters,
//!   collations and text weights arrive exactly as the user typed them and are
//!   parsed in Rust (gotcha #33). The frontend never parses BSON.
//! * **Every command rejects a non-MongoDB connection up front**, so a
//!   mis-routed call fails with a sentence rather than a type error deep in a
//!   driver.
//!
//! Creating and dropping an index **is** reachable over the MCP connector
//! (`create_index` / `drop_index`, both at the `full` tier — an index is
//! schema). Hiding and replacing are not: `collMod` reaches `hidden` and
//! nothing else, and a replace is a drop plus a create, which an AI client can
//! express as those two calls with the intermediate state visible to it. Both
//! MCP-reachable verbs go through the `_inner` cores below so a write is logged
//! whether it arrived from the UI, the bridge, or the connector's own pool —
//! a write core that does not take a [`LogSink`] is invisible in
//! `mcp-audit.log` (gotcha #49).
