//! Build-flavor introspection for the frontend.
//!
//! The React bundle is byte-for-byte identical between the stable and canary
//! builds — the only thing that differs is the Cargo `canary` feature and the
//! Tauri config overlay (`tauri.canary.conf.json`). That means the frontend
//! has no compile-time way to know which flavor it is running inside; it must
//! ask the backend at runtime. This command is that channel.
//!
//! It exists so the UI can make it *unmistakable* that you are in the sandbox
//! canary build (separate, isolated on-disk state — see
//! `crate::app_identity::APP_DIR` and CLAUDE.md gotcha #26) rather than your
//! real stable install, since the two are otherwise visually identical once
//! you are inside the window.
