//! Insert rows into a SQL table from pasted JSON text.
//!
//! The SQL counterpart of [`crate::commands::query::insert_documents`], and the
//! answer to a different gap than the one that command closes.
//!
//! `insert_documents` exists because a MongoDB collection is schemaless: the
//! grid's column set is sampled from one page of documents, so a field the
//! sample did not show could not be typed at all. That argument genuinely does
//! not carry over — a SQL table has a column set the server enforces, and
//! there is nothing free-form document text can express that
//! [`crate::commands::query::insert_row`] cannot.
//!
//! What SQL is missing is **bulk**. `insert_row` is one row per call, so
//! "paste these forty rows" has no path at all short of hand-writing an
//! `INSERT` in the query editor. That is `ROADMAP.md`'s open item #1, and it is
//! what this module is: one object, or an array of them, becomes **one**
//! multi-row `INSERT` inside **one** transaction.
//!
//! Three constraints shape everything below.
//!
//! **Keys are not column names until the catalogue says so.** A JSON key is
//! user input; `quote_ident` is documented as catalog-only (gotcha #4). So the
//! keys are matched against [`list_columns_inner`] and what reaches the SQL is
//! the *catalogue's* spelling, never the pasted one. An unmatched key is a
//! refusal that names it, not a column invented on the spot.
//!
//! **Values bind as text** (gotcha #5), so the coercion here is JSON → `String`
//! and the driver casts. The one thing text alone cannot get right is a
//! boolean, and the catalogue is what settles it — see [`coerce_value`].
//!
//! **Parse before touching the server.** Everything that can be rejected is
//! rejected while the pool is still untouched, so a typo is a message rather
//! than a half-applied insert. That is `insert_documents`' rule and it matters
//! more here, where one call can be thousands of rows.
