//! Tauri command handlers — the public surface the frontend invokes via

//! Modules here are organised by feature area and intentionally kept thin:
//! they validate arguments, look up state, and delegate the heavy lifting
//! to the [`crate::db`] / [`crate::keychain`] helpers.

/// [`connection::ensure_database_view`] call, differing only in which field
/// holds the id. Forgetting it is invisible until a
/// database view has been idle long enough to be reaped and the user clicks it,
/// at which point the command fails with `NotConnected` on a connection that is
/// genuinely still up — the exact false negative `ensure_database_view` exists
/// to remove. One call is one line now, and the `window` is taken whole rather
/// than pre-unwrapped to its label so a caller cannot pass the wrong one.
