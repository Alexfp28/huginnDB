//! Reading and writing the *document* a shared origin publishes.
//!
//! The model — what a draft is, how it becomes a file, what publishing one does
//! to everyone pulling from it — is [`crate::origin_doc`], and it is pure. This
//! module is the I/O half: it reads the path, resolves keychain secrets,
//! computes the content hash the optimistic-concurrency check rests on, and
//! writes the result atomically.
//!
//! Three things here are load-bearing.
//!
//! **Writing is opt-in per origin, and the OS gets the last word.** A registered
//! origin loads as [`OriginRole::Consumer`] (`tab_state::Origin::role`,
//! `#[serde(default)]`), so no existing origin becomes writable by installing an
//! update, and marking one as a publisher is a separate confirmed action. Even
//! then [`probe_origin_writable`] *tries* to create a file next to the document
//! before the editor offers to save: a share's ACL is the real perimeter
//! (`SECURITY.md`), and permission metadata on Windows routinely disagrees with
//! what a write actually does.
//!
//! **Concurrency is optimistic, by content hash.** [`open_origin_document`]
//! stamps the file's SHA-256 into a [`DraftBase`]; [`save_origin_document`]
//! re-reads and re-hashes before writing and refuses on a mismatch, handing back
//! the newer document instead of overwriting it. A lock file would be worse than
//! nothing here — a laptop dropping off the VPN mid-edit would strand the team's
//! document rather than protect it.
//!
//! **Every path that can decrypt runs off the main thread.** Landing or rotating
//! a secret costs ~600 000 PBKDF2 rounds *per slot*, and a synchronous
//! `#[tauri::command]` runs on the thread pumping the window — the exact freeze
//! `sync_origin` documents at length. Anything that touches a passphrase here is
//! an `async fn` whose body sits on `spawn_blocking`.
