//! Local IPC bridge between the desktop app and the `huginndb-mcp` sidecar.
//!
//! # Why
//!
//! The sidecar is a separate OS process with its own `AppState` and its own
//! pools, and there is **one sidecar per MCP client**. A developer running the
//! desktop app plus Claude Code plus Claude Desktop therefore has three
//! independent connection budgets against the same database, none of which can
//! see the others — the last remaining way HuginnDB's footprint could surprise
//! someone after the per-server budgets landed ([`crate::db::endpoint`]).
//!
//! When the bridge is enabled and the desktop app is running, the sidecar stops
//! opening pools altogether and forwards its data-path calls here. The app
//! becomes the single owner of every HuginnDB connection on the machine: one
//! budget, one place to see it, one place to cap it. As a side effect that is
//! worth as much as the budget, MCP-driven reads and writes show up in the
//! app's Console in real time, instead of only in `mcp-audit.log`.
//!
//! When the app is *not* running, the sidecar falls back to opening its own
//! pools exactly as before. Nothing about the MCP surface changes either way.
//!
//! # Transport, and why it isn't a Unix socket
//!
//! Loopback TCP on an OS-assigned port, with a token. A Unix domain socket
//! would give peer credentials for free on Linux/macOS — but HuginnDB's primary
//! platform is Windows, where the equivalent is a named pipe with a completely
//! different API that cannot be compiled or tested from a Unix CI box. Shipping
//! the strong path only where it can be tested, and an untested `#[cfg(windows)]`
//! branch on the platform most users are on, is the wrong trade: this project
//! has already been burnt twice by Windows-only build paths (see CLAUDE.md
//! gotchas #20 and #21). One transport, identical everywhere, testable
//! everywhere.
//!
//! # Security posture
//!
//! * **Off by default** (`connections.mcpBridge`). A listening socket that
//!   fronts every database the user has saved is not something to enable behind
//!   someone's back, however narrow the exposure.
//! * **Bound to `127.0.0.1`**, never `0.0.0.0` — nothing off-machine can reach
//!   it.
//! * **Token-gated.** Every request carries a per-run random token; a mismatch
//!   is refused and the connection dropped. The token lives in
//!   [`DISCOVERY_FILE`] alongside the port, written `0600` on Unix, so another
//!   user on the same machine can reach the port but cannot authenticate.
//! * **The write policy is re-checked here**, not trusted from the caller. The
//!   sidecar already enforces [`crate::state::McpWritePolicy`] before it sends,
//!   but this is a privileged surface and a second, independent check is what
//!   keeps a bug (or anything else that finds the token) from writing to a
//!   connection the user marked read-only.
//!
//! What it does *not* defend against: another process running as the same user.
//! That process can already read `profiles.json`, and the OS keychain is
//! typically unlocked for the logged-in session — the bridge is not a new
//! capability for an attacker who is already you.
