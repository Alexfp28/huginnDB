//! The read surface HuginnDB describes to a model, and the mapping from a tool
//! call back onto [`BridgeRequest`].
//!
//! # Why a second catalogue instead of reusing `crate::mcp`'s
//!
//! The `#[tool]` macros in `crate::mcp` are rmcp-specific *presentation*: they
//! produce an MCP tool router, over a transport, for a client that speaks MCP.
//! What an OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions` call needs is a JSON array of
//! `{name, description, parameters}` plus a dispatcher — the same substance in
//! a different envelope. Both envelopes sit over the one [`BridgeRequest`] /
//! [`crate::bridge::exec`] data path, which is why phase 1 refactors nothing:
//! it adds a presentation layer, it does not move the surface it presents.
//!
//! # Why [`exposure`] has no `_` arm
//!
//! `crate::bridge::server`'s `policy_id_of` and `class_of` both end in
//! `_ => None`, so a [`BridgeRequest`] variant added without touching them is
//! silently unclassified rather than a build error (gotcha #49). Those two now
//! have a second consumer, which doubles the stakes — and this module answers a
//! *sharper* question than they do: not "which tier does this need" but "may a
//! language model reach this at all, and does its reply carry rows". Getting
//! that wrong is exactly how the metadata-only guarantee leaks.
//!
//! So [`exposure`] is an exhaustive match, the pattern `MongoOp::class` uses
//! (gotcha #54): a new variant does not compile until somebody has decided, in
//! writing, whether a model may call it. That is the whole mechanism, and it is
//! why this module keeps its own mapping instead of extending `class_of`.
