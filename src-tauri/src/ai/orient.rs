//! What the assistant is told about the database *before* it starts looking.
//!
//! # The gap this closes
//!
//! Agent mode gave the model tools and nothing else, so its first move was
//! always a guess: it would fix on the one table or the one column the question
//! named and answer about that, because it had no way to know what else was
//! there. Asked about a `settings` column it would describe that column; it
//! could not notice that the answer lived in a neighbouring table, because as
//! far as it knew the neighbour did not exist.
//!
//! A person reading the schema tree has the map on screen before they type. An
//! agent that has to discover the map by spending iterations on it will
//! usually not bother — and a small model, with six steps and a small context,
//! genuinely cannot afford to. So the map is handed over up front: one
//! `list_tables` read, in the system message, before the first model call.
//!
//! # Why this is one read and not a schema dump
//!
//! Names are cheap and structure is not. Eighty table names cost a few hundred
//! tokens; eighty `describe_table` replies would fill the window and leave no
//! room for the question — the same trade `crate::ai::exec`'s size budget
//! exists for. Names are enough to orient: they tell the model what the
//! database is *about*, and which of the tools to spend its steps on.
//!
//! Deliberately not cached. A catalog read against a live connection is
//! milliseconds next to a completion that takes seconds, and a cache here
//! would be a second copy of the schema that can be wrong — the schema tree's
//! own warm state already taught that lesson (gotcha #55).
