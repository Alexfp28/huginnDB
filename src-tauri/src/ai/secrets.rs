//! Where a BYOK key lives — and where it does not.
//!
//! The key goes to the OS keychain, under the same service every other HuginnDB
//! credential uses ([`crate::keychain::SERVICE`]), and **never** to
//! `prefs.json`. `prefs.json` is world-readable, is copied around by people
//! syncing their dotfiles, and is the file this project already promises holds
//! nothing sensitive; a provider key in it would be a plaintext secret on disk,
//! which is the one thing the connection layer has never done either.
//!
//! It is also never returned to the frontend. Phase 3's command surface exposes
//! `ai_set_key` / `ai_has_key` / `ai_clear_key`, so the webview can tell the
//! user whether a key is stored and can replace it, but cannot read it back.
//! The key is only ever assembled into an `Authorization` header inside
//! [`crate::ai::provider`], which is the same shape as connection passwords:
//! the webview knows a secret exists and never holds one.
//!
//! # Keyed by the endpoint's origin
//!
//! Not by a provider name the user types. Two reasons, and the first is a
//! security property: a key belongs to the host that issued it, so keying by
//! origin makes it structurally impossible for an OpenRouter token to be sent
//! to a different endpoint after the base URL is edited. The second is
//! ergonomic — a user who keeps a local Ollama *and* a cloud provider
//! configured switches between them without retyping anything, because the two
//! keys (one of them absent) sit under different accounts.
//!
//! Origin means scheme + host + port, so `/v1` and `/api/v1` on the same host
//! share a key. That is correct: they are the same server, and Azure's
//! per-deployment paths all authenticate with one key.
