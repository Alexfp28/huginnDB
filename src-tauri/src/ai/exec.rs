//! Execute one tool call the model emitted, under the gates that make the
//! feature's promises true.
//!
//! Seven steps, in this order:
//!
//! 1. resolve the connection reference — an id **or** a name, like the MCP
//!    connector's `canonical_connection` — among the connections the user has
//!    enabled for the assistant,
//! 2. resolve the [`DataScope`] from the endpoint's declared trust and that
//!    connection's own `ai_rows_allowed`,
//! 3. look the tool up *in the catalogue that scope offers*,
//! 4. resolve the MongoDB per-database target, if the call named one,
//! 5. build the [`BridgeRequest`] and refuse a `run_query` that is not a read,
//! 6. re-check the connection's write policy through
//!    [`crate::bridge::server::check_policy`],
//! 7. run it through [`crate::bridge::exec::execute`] with a [`LogSink`], then
//!    cap the reply's rows, strip the fields a model has no use for, and bound
//!    what is left by *size* — see [`MAX_TOOL_RESULT_CHARS`] for the failure
//!    that last step exists for.
//!
//! # Where the tests are
//!
//! [`execute`] itself has none, and that is deliberate rather than an
//! omission: it needs an [`AppState`], whose construction reads the real
//! `profiles.json` / `tab_state.json`, and [`crate::bridge::server::check_policy`]
//! reads `profiles.json` from disk on every call — gotcha #52 is explicit that
//! a test which reaches either is a test whose answer depends on the
//! developer's own saved connections. So every *decision* [`execute`] makes is
//! a free function over plain arguments ([`resolve_connection`],
//! [`refuse_unless_read`], [`effective_row_cap`], [`cap_rows`], and
//! `tools::available` / `tools::to_request` next door), and those are what the
//! suite pins. What is left in [`execute`] is the order they run in.
//!
//! # Two things this deliberately does not do
//!
//! * **It does not connect.** A reference that resolves to a profile with no
//!   live pool fails with [`crate::error::AppError::NotConnected`], rather than
//!   opening one from the keychain the way the headless connector does. The
//!   assistant works on connections the user has open; an AI panel that could
//!   dial out to a server nobody had opened this session is a different
//!   feature, and a worse one to have arrived by accident.
//! * **It does not write.** No write variant is in the catalogue (D4) and
//!   `run_query`'s free text is classified before it runs. See
//!   [`refuse_unless_read`].
