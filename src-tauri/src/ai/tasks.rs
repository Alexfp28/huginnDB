//! Assisted mode: four jobs whose context HuginnDB assembles itself.
//!
//! # Why this exists before agent mode
//!
//! Roadmap Answer B — *shrink the job, not the model*. A tool loop needs a
//! model that emits reliable tool calls, which the hardware table says is a 14B
//! and up; an office laptop runs a 4B. But a 4B is perfectly capable of
//! explaining a statement it was *handed*, or writing SQL against a schema it
//! was *given*. So the intelligence that decides what to read moves out of the
//! model and into this file: one model call, no iteration, and a prompt whose
//! every byte was chosen here.
//!
//! That is also why assisted mode ships first. It is the mode most users can
//! actually run, and a feature that only works on a workstation is a feature
//! most of this project's users would never see.
//!
//! # The seam, and why it is where it is
//!
//! [`gather`] does the I/O — one `bridge::exec` call per thing a task needs —
//! and [`build_prompt`] is **pure**: context in, messages out. Everything worth
//! testing is in the second one. A prompt regression is invisible (the model
//! still answers, just worse), so the only defence is a test that pins what the
//! prompt contains, and that test cannot exist if building it requires a
//! database.
//!
//! # The row rule still holds
//!
//! Only [`AssistedTask::DocumentRelation`] reads rows at all, and only under
//! [`DataScope::Rows`]. Under metadata-only it drops the sample and says so in
//! the prompt rather than becoming unavailable — a documentation task that
//! refuses to run is worse than one that documents from the schema, which is
//! most of what it was going to do anyway.
