//! Agent mode: the tool-call loop.
//!
//! Request → `tool_calls` → [`crate::ai::exec`] → tool results → repeat, until
//! the model answers without asking for anything or a budget stops it.
//!
//! # Why this is last, and gated
//!
//! It is the mode that needs a model most people cannot run. A small model
//! asked to chain tool calls does not degrade — it fabricates, or emits
//! `tool_calls` whose arguments are not JSON, and the assistant *looks* like it
//! is working right up to the point where nothing it claims to have read was
//! ever read. So [`crate::ai::probe`] measures the endpoint first and this
//! refuses to run unless the answer was
//! [`crate::ai::probe::Capability::ToolCapable`]. Assisted mode
//! ([`crate::ai::tasks`]) is what everyone else gets, and it is not a
//! consolation prize: for four common jobs it is *better*, because the context
//! was chosen deliberately rather than discovered.
//!
//! # The Console is the feature, not the logging
//!
//! Every iteration emits: the tools it was offered, each call with its
//! arguments, and each result's **size**. That is the roadmap's own claim and
//! it is worth restating, because it looks like instrumentation and is not — a
//! user who can watch what the assistant did and how much came back will
//! believe the metadata-only guarantee; one who cannot, will not. The result
//! *payload* is deliberately never logged: it is the row data the guarantee is
//! about, and writing it to a panel the user can copy out of would be an odd
//! way to keep it.
//!
//! # Budgets, and what happens at the end of one
//!
//! Four hard caps: iterations, total tool calls, the row and character caps
//! every reply already carries ([`crate::ai::exec`]), and a **turn-wide**
//! character budget across all of them. The last exists because the loop
//! re-sends its whole accumulated history on every iteration, so twelve replies
//! that each fit comfortably still add up to a context nobody can hold — the
//! per-reply cap bounds one read, and this bounds the turn.
//!
//! A loop that hits any of them stops and says so *in the transcript* rather
//! than silently returning half an investigation, because "the model gave up"
//! and "the model was cut off" are different facts and only one of them is
//! worth retrying.
//!
//! # The webview does not write the system prompt here
//!
//! The panel sends a chat prompt that tells the model it has no database
//! access, which is true of plain chat and false here. The loop drops whatever
//! system message arrived and supplies its own ([`system_message`]:
//! [`SYSTEM_PROMPT`] plus the connection's dialect brief). That is mostly
//! hygiene — the frontend is ours — but it also means the one instruction that
//! governs what the assistant may do with its tools is not something a page can
//! rewrite.

/// *every* statement: asked for the last three rows of a table, it explained
/// that it needed to know the ordering column and suggested the user run
/// `DESCRIBE logRecord` — while holding a `describe_table` tool. Twice in one
/// session it wrote out a `SELECT` and waited to be told to run it.
///
/// So the ordering and the scoping are the design here, not the phrasing:
///
/// * The reading instruction comes first, names the tools, and forbids the
///   specific failure (asking the user to run a read) rather than merely
///   encouraging the opposite.
/// * The write restriction is scoped **explicitly and by name** to statements
///   that change something. "You cannot write" alone is a sentence a small
///   model applies to SQL in general.
/// * "Never say you are showing data you did not receive" is separate from
///   both, because the observed failure was a model announcing "here are the
///   last three records" above a query it had not run.
///
/// The other load-bearing line is the older one: never claim to have read
/// something a tool did not return. A confident answer about a schema nobody
/// looked at is worse than no answer, because the user cannot tell them apart.
