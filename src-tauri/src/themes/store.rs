//! `installed_themes.json` — the library of themes that came from a file or a
//! registry, and everything needed to update one.
//!
//! # Why this file exists at all
//!
//! Before it, an imported theme lived entirely in the frontend's
//! localStorage-backed theme store, which was right for a handful of
//! hand-imported ones and stops being right the moment a registry browser can
//! install a dozen. The split is by *shape*, not by size alone:
//!
//! - **The palettes stay in localStorage.** Thirty hex values per variant,
//!   read synchronously before first paint so the app does not flash the
//!   wrong theme (`STORAGE_KEYS.theme`, and see the FOUC note in
//!   `CLAUDE.md`). Moving them here would mean an async read on the critical
//!   path to fix a problem they do not have.
//! - **The editor themes and the install metadata come here.** A Monaco theme
//!   is the big part — One Dark Pro's 275 token rules serialise to ~20 KB, and
//!   a library of those is exactly what localStorage should not hold — and it
//!   is also the part that tolerates arriving late: `registerImported-
//!   MonacoThemes` defines whatever it is given whenever it is given it, so an
//!   editor that mounts first is repainted rather than broken.
//!
//! # The backend still has no opinion about colour
//!
//! `editor_themes` is stored as opaque JSON. This module does not know what an
//! `IStandaloneThemeData` is and must not learn: the conversion lives in
//! `src/lib/vscodeTheme/`, and a second interpretation here would be the
//! divergence gotchas #30/#33 exist to prevent.
