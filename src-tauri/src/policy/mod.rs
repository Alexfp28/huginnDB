//! Managed policy: per-role permissions an administrator sets once, for every
//! installation in an organization. `docs/POLICY_ROADMAP.md` is the
//! specification. This module holds the document, where it is read from, and
//! the decisions made on it; phase 1 is the part that binds **the AI**.
//!
//! For the AI this is an enforcement point, not a guardrail: the model never
//! holds a database credential, and every request it can make is a
//! [`crate::bridge::protocol::BridgeRequest`] executed by [`crate::bridge::exec::execute`], whose four
//! callers all act for an AI (the MCP sidecar served by the app, the sidecar
//! running alone, the AI panel's agent, and its assisted tasks). [`enforce`]
//! runs at the top of that function, so none of the four can miss it. The
//! three things that do not pass through it are checked where they are:
//! `EnsureConnected` (in `bridge::server::dispatch` and the sidecar's
//! `ensure_connected`), the MCP `list_connections` tool
//! ([`reachable_by_ai`]), and the AI panel's catalogue ([`free_sql_blocked`]).
//!
//! Policy only ever **narrows**. The per-connection settings — `mcp_exposed`,
//! `mcp_write`, `ai_enabled` — are still checked where they always were, so
//! what the AI may do is the policy ∩ the local settings.
//!
//! People (phase 2) are bound by the `human` blocks in every command, as a
//! guardrail (`commands::guard`); phase 3 gives each person their own database
//! user (`crate::credentials`) and writes the grants that make the database
//! agree ([`grants`]); phase 4 is the in-app [`editor`], which saves only where
//! the share's permissions allow.
