//! Running SQL on a [`DbPool`], whatever driver is behind it.
//!
//! [`crate::db::sql::Dialect`] owns every per-engine difference in the SQL
//! *text*. This module is its counterpart for *running* it — the piece that was
//! missing, which is why twelve call sites in `commands/` each wrote out the
//! same five-arm `match pool`, two of them byte-identical to each other.
//!
//! The arms are near-identical by construction, so there was never much to
//! choose between them: `sqlx`'s three pools share an API, and [`MsSqlPool`] was
//! deliberately built to expose the same surface (`query_all` /
//! `execute_params` / `execute_simple` / `scalar`), so its arm here is one line
//! in every function. What the duplication actually cost was the guarantee: a
//! new engine had to be threaded through twelve bodies, and a `_ =>` in any one
//! of them would have silently given it Postgres's behaviour (gotcha #30).
//!
//! **MongoDB never reaches these functions.** It is not a SQL dialect; every
//! command dispatches it to [`crate::db::mongo`] before any SQL is built. A
//! `DbPool::Mongo` here is a programming error, and the `unreachable!` arms say
//! so rather than inventing a fallback — matching what the individual call sites
//! already did.
//!
//! Values cross as `Option<String>` end-to-end (gotcha #5): the cell editor only
//! ever emits text and the drivers cast textual literals server-side. Anything
//! needing a per-driver cast around the placeholder (a MySQL `BIT`, a SQL Server
//! `varbinary`) builds that into the SQL *before* getting here.
