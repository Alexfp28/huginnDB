//! Structured log bus.
//!
//! Every command that touches the database (query execution, table-data
//! paging, cell edits, row inserts/deletes, connection lifecycle) emits a
//! [`LogEntry`] through this module. The frontend listens for the
//! `huginndb://log` Tauri event and renders the entries in the Console
//! panel — analogous to HeidiSQL's SQL log.
//!
//! Design rules:
//!
//! * Emission is fire-and-forget. A failure inside `emit()` must never
//!   propagate up and break the originating DB operation. We swallow
//!   the error silently — at worst the user loses an entry from a
//!   debugging panel.
//! * Entries are flat (no enums in the wire payload) so the TypeScript
//!   side can mirror them with a single interface and no discriminator
//!   parsing.
