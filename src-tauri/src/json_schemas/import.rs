//! Merging an imported [`JsonSchemaBundle`] into the local library.
//!
//! Pure: no filesystem, no keychain, no `AppState`, and `now` is a parameter
//! rather than a call to `Utc::now()`, so every rule below is testable.
//!
//! # Import never merges *identities*
//!
//! Same rule as gotcha #35: an import mints fresh ids and never adopts one from
//! the file. What it does reconcile is **names**, because a schema library is
//! global and two machines will genuinely have a `product-config` each. The
//! conflict machinery (`ConflictAction`, `ImportConflict`) is the profile
//! importer's, reused verbatim so the wizard behaves identically.
//!
//! # The connection-id problem
//!
//! A binding pinned to a connection is the one part of this payload that is not
//! portable: a profile id is a uuid minted on the machine that created it. The
//! rule is **disable, never widen and never silently drop**:
//!
//! * Widening it to a wildcard would change what the rule *means* — a schema for
//!   one server would start applying to every server.
//! * Dropping it silently loses the user's intent with no way to notice.
//! * Disabling it keeps the intent (the original `connection_id` is preserved,
//!   which is the only thing that lets anyone see what the rule meant), is
//!   inert while off, is visible in the Settings table, and is one click to fix.
//!
//! An environment import is the lucky case: `apply_profile_imports` hands back
//! an original-to-new id map, so there the id is *translated* instead — exactly
//! what already happens to `launch.visible_connections`.
