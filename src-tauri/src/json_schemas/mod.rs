//! User-defined JSON Schema library and per-column bindings.
//!
//! Lives next to `profiles.json` in the platform config dir:
//!
//! * Windows — `%APPDATA%\HuginnDB\json_schemas.json`
//! * Linux   — `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/HuginnDB/json_schemas.json`
//! * macOS   — `~/Library/Application Support/HuginnDB/json_schemas.json`
//!
//! # Why a file of its own, and not `prefs.json`
//!
//! A real configuration schema is 50–200 KB, and `prefs.json` is rewritten
//! (debounced 400 ms) on every `Ctrl`+wheel of the grid and every column
//! resize. Rewriting hundreds of KB per zoom step is not acceptable, and a
//! schema is a *document* anyway, not a preference.
//!
//! # Why global, and not per environment
//!
//! A binding is `(table, column)`: it belongs to the *server*, not to the
//! Producción/Staging axis. Putting it on `Environment` would reproduce the
//! `visible_databases` bug (gotcha #27) exactly — the same table would have a
//! schema in one environment and not in another. `tab_state.json` is also
//! LRU-pruned, which a user-authored library must never be. The right
//! precedent is [`crate::prefs::GridPrefs`]'s `column_widths`, which is
//! likewise "something per table column" and likewise global.
//!
//! # Why `body` is text, and why nothing here parses it
//!
//! `serde_json::Map` is a `BTreeMap` unless the `preserve_order` feature is
//! on, so storing a schema as a `Value` would silently re-sort every key
//! alphabetically on each save — the user opens their schema and `$schema`,
//! `title` and `properties` have moved. Turning `preserve_order` on is not an
//! option either: it is a *global* feature of `serde_json` in this tree and
//! would change key order for every `Value` in the app (BSON conversions,
//! Extended JSON, `internal_layout`, `bson_to_shell_text`) — precisely the
//! invisible-and-permanent loss gotchas #17/#29/#34 are about.
//!
//! A body is therefore stored as **source text** and this module **never
//! parses it**. The only JSON Schema parser in the product is the one already
//! inside Monaco's bundled JSON worker, which keeps gotcha #33's "one grammar,
//! one parser" trivially true. The cost — `json_schemas.json` is awkward to
//! hand-edit because bodies are escaped strings — is the same one
//! `tab_state.json` already accepts for `PersistedTab::query`.
//!
//! # Versioning
//!
//! `prefs.rs`'s pattern, not `tab_state.rs`'s: `#[serde(default)]` everywhere
//! and **no** migration machinery. `tab_state` carries `RawState`/`into_state`
//! because three real, incompatible reshapes happened; building that scaffold
//! here today would be code no test ever exercises. The shape (two `Vec`s of
//! records) is additive by construction, and `version` exists so a genuine
//! reshape can be detected if one ever comes.
