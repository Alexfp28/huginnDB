//! Fixtures shared by the unit tests, so a new field on a domain struct is one
//! edit rather than six.
//!
//! Six test modules — `commands::connection`, `store`, `transfer`,
//! `db::pool`, `db::endpoint` and `pool_reaper` — each carried a private
//! `fn profile(..)` building the same nineteen-field [`ConnectionProfile`],
//! varying one to three of them. Every field added to that struct since has
//! had to be added to all six before the suite compiled again, which is
//! busywork that also quietly discourages adding a test module.
//!
//! The baseline is deliberately boring: a local Postgres profile with no
//! tunnel, no group, no origin and default everything else. A test that needs
//! something else says so with struct-update syntax, which keeps the *reason*
//! visible at the test rather than buried in a fixture:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! ConnectionProfile { host: "alpha".into(), ..testkit::profile("p") }
//! ```
