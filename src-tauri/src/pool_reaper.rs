//! Background eviction of idle per-database connection pools.
//!
//! Browsing a multi-database server opens one whole extra pool per database
//! (`<parent>::db::<name>`, see `commands::connection::open_database_view`).
//! Until 1.13.0 nothing ever closed them: the only removal paths were the
//! *parent*'s `disconnect` and `drop_database`, so a database expanded once at
//! 09:00 — or, worse, a dozen of them opened at once by a single keystroke in
//! the schema explorer's cross-database search — still held a pool at 18:00.
//!
//! That is the difference between a footprint that tracks *what the user is
//! doing* and one that tracks *everything the user has ever done in this
//! session*, and it is a large part of why HuginnDB was tipping shared servers
//! over their connection limit alongside the rest of a developer's toolchain.
//!
//! This module closes the gap with the smallest policy that fixes it:
//!
//! * **TTL** — a child pool untouched for `connections.childIdleTtlSecs` is
//!   closed. Reopening costs one round trip and the frontend's schema cache is
//!   untouched, so the user cannot tell the difference.
//! * **LRU cap** — a connection may hold at most `connections.maxChildPools`
//!   children; past that the longest-unused are closed regardless of age. The
//!   TTL alone doesn't bound the *burst* (twelve databases opened in one
//!   second are all equally fresh), and the burst is what trips the server.
//!
//! Top-level pools a **person** opened are deliberately never reaped: they
//! represent a connection the user asked for and the UI shows as connected, so
//! closing one behind their back would be a lie. The MCP sidecar, which has no
//! such UI and no user watching, *does* reap its top-level pools — see
//! `crate::mcp::spawn_idle_pool_reaper`.
//!
//! That exemption used to be unconditional, and the MCP bridge falsified its
//! premise. A pool `crate::bridge::server` opens on a sidecar's behalf goes
//! through the app's own `connect_inner`, so it landed here as an ordinary
//! top-level pool — but no user opened it, no window shows it (the frontend
//! does not listen for `connection-opened`), and `release_idle_pools` skips
//! top-level pools by contract, so nothing in the product could release it.
//! The same connection was reaped in five minutes when the sidecar owned the
//! pool and lived until the app exited when the app did. [`PoolOrigin`] is the
//! discriminator, and `connections.bridgeIdleTtlSecs` — defaulting to the
//! sidecar's own TTL — is the schedule. See gotcha #67.
