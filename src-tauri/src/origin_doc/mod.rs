//! The *document* a shared origin publishes, as an editable draft.
//!
//! A shared origin (#108) was pull-only: [`crate::commands::origins::sync_origin`]
//! reads the file and never writes it, so publishing meant a human running
//! `export_environments`, picking a destination in the native dialog, and
//! dropping the JSON on the share. Updating it meant repeating that export from
//! whatever the publisher happened to have mounted at that moment — or editing
//! the JSON by hand.
//!
//! This module is the model behind an *editor* for that file: a draft the user
//! composes, plus the pure functions that load one from a file, build a file
//! back out of one, and predict what publishing it would do to everyone pulling
//! from it. The I/O — reading the path, resolving keychain secrets, writing
//! atomically — lives in [`crate::commands::origin_doc`]. Nothing here touches a
//! disk or a keychain, which is the whole reason the rules below are testable at
//! all (CLAUDE.md gotcha #52: the first tests written against
//! `merge_profiles_bundle` overwrote the developer's own `profiles.json`,
//! because the only entry point insisted on saving first).
//!
//! Four invariants shape everything in here.
//!
//! ## 1. The editor edits a document, not the local state
//!
//! An [`OriginDraft`] lives in memory and never touches `profiles.json`,
//! `tab_state.json` or `json_schemas.json` — and, symmetrically, saving one
//! changes nothing locally. A publisher composes "the team's file" as a
//! document, which is what lets them publish a connection they have never
//! opened and edit one they no longer have.
//!
//! ## 2. One constructor for the file
//!
//! [`crate::transfer::EnvironmentExportFile`] **already is** the format, so this
//! module invents nothing: [`build_origin_file`] assembles that exact type and
//! reuses [`crate::transfer::metadata`]. Mirrors gotcha #16 (the DDL is built in
//! Rust, never in the component) and #33 (one grammar, one parser): a second
//! writer would drift, and the drift would be silent, because a consumer's sync
//! reports "read cleanly" either way.
//!
//! ## 3. A secret that did not change travels verbatim
//!
//! [`crate::commands::origins::already_landed`] skips the ~600 000 PBKDF2 rounds
//! *per slot* of landing a secret when the ciphertext's fingerprint matches what
//! this machine already decrypted. Since [`crate::transfer::encrypt_secret`]
//! draws a fresh salt and nonce on every call, re-encrypting on every save would
//! invalidate that cache for the whole team — tens of millions of SHA-256 rounds
//! each, on their next sync, because somebody changed an environment's colour.
//! [`SecretSlot::Keep`] is therefore what everything loaded from the file gets,
//! and it is copied byte for byte. Rotating the passphrase is the one operation
//! that must re-encrypt everything, and [`PublishImpact::reencryption`] exists so
//! that cost is announced rather than discovered.
//!
//! ## 4. `source_environment_id` is sacred
//!
//! It is the identity [`crate::commands::origins::sync_origin`] matches a bundle
//! against its local mirror with — the `(origin_id, origin_source_id)` pair on
//! [`crate::tab_state::Environment`]. Minting a fresh one while editing makes
//! every consumer see that environment **disappear** and a different one appear,
//! losing the tabs, layout and filters they had in it. A [`DraftEnvironment`]
//! loaded from a file keeps its own; only one created from scratch gets a new
//! uuid, and that is the command layer's job, not [`build_origin_file`]'s. The
//! same applies one level down to `ConnectionProfile::id`: adding a local
//! connection to the document keeps its id, which is what lets a publisher
//! consume their own origin without ending up with two copies of every server.
