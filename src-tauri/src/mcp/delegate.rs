//! Hand the MCP session to the connector installed next to the desktop app.
//!
//! The `.mcpb` bundle Claude Desktop installs carries its own copy of
//! `huginndb-mcp` and runs it from the client's extensions folder. Updating
//! HuginnDB replaces the copy next to `huginndb.exe`, never that one, so
//! without this the extension kept serving the version it was installed with
//! — including, for a bundle older than 1.29, a connector that does not know
//! the managed policy exists. The fix is for every copy that is *not* the
//! installed one to launch the installed one and step aside: the extension is
//! installed once, and updates arrive with the app.
//!
//! It always delegates when an installed copy exists, without comparing
//! versions. What matters is that the connector matches the app that writes
//! `profiles.json` and reads the policy, not which of two binaries is newer.
//!
//! Runs before anything else in `huginndb-mcp`'s `main`: no state loaded, no
//! policy read, and nothing written to stdout, which is the JSON-RPC channel
//! the child inherits.
