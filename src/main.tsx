// trigger, so this only ever suppresses the native one on the areas that
// don't have a custom menu of their own (blank tree space, the row-number

// keeps its *default* action for a dropped file: navigate to `file:///…`,
// replacing the entire app with the dropped document and no chrome to go back
// with. Anything that genuinely accepts a file already calls `preventDefault`
// in its own handler, so this only ever catches a near miss.
//
// Deliberately gated on the drag carrying files: every internal drag (dockview
// tabs, the environment rail's `@dnd-kit` sortable, text into Monaco) must keep
// its default behaviour, and none of those set the `Files` type.

//               `TabKind` and never appears in the workspace.
