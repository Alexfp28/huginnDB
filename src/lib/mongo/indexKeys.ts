 * Index-key helpers for the MongoDB index manager.

 * parse BSON. That distinction is the same one `lib/mongo/pipeline.ts` draws
 * for stage bodies (gotcha #33): Rust owns the only grammar, and anything
 * here that looked like a parser would eventually disagree with it in
 * silence. What this module does is narrower and safe: recognise the handful
 * of key values MongoDB actually accepts (`1`, `-1`, and the type strings)
 * so the dialog can offer a picker, and bail out to raw text for anything
 * else.
