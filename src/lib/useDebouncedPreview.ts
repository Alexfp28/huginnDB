/**
 * Re-run a preview a beat after its input last changed.
 *
 * The structure and view editors both preview by round-tripping to the backend
 * — `preview_structure_change` builds the DDL in Rust (gotcha #16), the view
 * editor also runs a `LIMIT`ed query — so every keystroke would otherwise be an
 * IPC call and, for the view editor, a real query against the server.
 *
 * `AggregationTab` deliberately keeps its own, longer delay: each of its
 * previews runs the pipeline *prefix* for every stage, so the work per fire is
 * not comparable and the two numbers are not one number.
