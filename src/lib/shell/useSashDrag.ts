/**
 * Pointer-capture drag for `Sash`, with `pointermove` coalesced to one
 * `onResize` call per animation frame.
 *
 * A drag fires `pointermove` far faster than the screen can repaint (~120Hz
 * observed), while only one panel width can ever be shown per frame anyway.
 * Calling `onResize` synchronously per event — as `Sash` used to — writes to
 * the panel-layout store, and therefore re-renders everything subscribed to
 * that width, up to twice as often as the browser could ever paint the
 * result.
 *
 * Coalescing must SUM the deltas dropped in the same frame, never discard
 * all but the last: at 60Hz a frame can only show one position, but the
 * cursor may have moved through several `pointermove` events to get there,
 * and discarding the earlier ones would make the panel edge trail behind
 * the cursor and drift further behind every frame — exactly what `Sash`'s
 * own "always 1:1 with the pointer" contract forbids. Summing keeps the
 * *total* delta correct; only how often it's flushed changes.
 *
 * Extracted out of `Sash.tsx` as a hook because it owns state (the pending
 * delta, the rAF handle) rather than merely borrowing it — see CLAUDE.md
 * gotcha #28's rule for when a hook is a legitimate extraction.
