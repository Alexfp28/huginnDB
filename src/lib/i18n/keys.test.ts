/**
 * Every `t("literal")` in the source resolves, and the two locales agree.
 *
 * This exists because a missing key is **invisible to every other check**.
 * TypeScript does not type `t()`'s argument, no test mounts every component,
 * and i18next's own fallback is to render the key itself — so the failure
 * ships as `common.previous` sitting in a button where a word should be, and
 * is only found by someone looking at that button. It was: a pagination footer
 * went out referencing two keys that had never been added.
 *
 * Only string literals are checked. A key built from a variable
 * (`t(\`settings.appearance.importError.${e.message}\`)`) cannot be resolved
 * statically, and guessing at the possible suffixes would either miss cases or
 * invent them.
