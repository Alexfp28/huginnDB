/**
 * The Monaco options that come from the user's editor preferences.
 *
 * Seven surfaces mount a Monaco — the query editor, the pipeline editor, the
 * cell editor, its docked twin, the Console detail pane, the JSON Schema body
 * editor and the DDL preview — and each assembled its own options object. The
 * option *sets* genuinely differ (the Console adds `domReadOnly` and turns
 * folding off; the schema editor is the one that wants folding on; the DDL
 * preview forces line numbers off regardless of the preference), so this is not
 * one shared object.
 *
 * What was repeated seven times is narrower and worth owning: *which*
 * preferences reach Monaco, and how each is spelled — `wordWrap` as
 * `"on" | "off"` rather than a boolean, `minimap` as `{ enabled }`. Adding an
 * editor preference used to mean finding all seven sites.
 *
 * Spread it and override:
 *
 *     options={{ ...editorOptionsFromPrefs(prefs), readOnly: true, folding: false }}
