/**
 * Shared redispatch for the customizable actions Monaco would otherwise
 * swallow inside its own focus area (gotcha #9 in CLAUDE.md).
 *
 * `editor.addCommand` can't work here: it resolves a fixed keybinding
 * bitmask once, inside Monaco's own keybinding service, before the handler
 * ever runs — there's no way to re-check a user-rebindable combo at call
 * time. `editor.onKeyDown` gives us the raw `KeyboardEvent` instead.
 *
 * What it feeds that event to is the *same* `createKeyDispatcher` the window
 * listener uses, so an action bound to a chord sequence works inside the
 * editor exactly as it does outside it, and the editor no longer carries its
 * own idea of what beats what. The scope is `editor`, plus `global`.
