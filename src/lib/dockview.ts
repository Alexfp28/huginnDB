/**
 * Panels that `hydrateWorkspaceLayout` restored from a saved geometry blob
 * whose tab hadn't shown up in `useTabs` yet at that moment — keyed by panel
 * (= tab) id, valued by the connection id from that panel's own params.
 *
 * Why this needs to exist at all: a saved split's panel ids only match
 * `useTabs` once every tab that owned one is back — but a table/query/security
 * tab against a multi-DB "database view" child (`<parent>::db::<database>`)
 * is NOT restored by `restoreSession`'s reconnect loop. It comes back later,
 * asynchronously, whenever `SchemaExplorer`'s own auto-re-expand effect (for a
 * database node that was expanded before) gets around to calling
 * `openTrackedDatabaseView` — a completely separate React component's effect,
 * on its own schedule, decoupled from `restoreSession` entirely. If
 * `hydrateWorkspaceLayout` waited for `useTabs` to already contain that tab
 * before restoring the split (an earlier version of this fix tried exactly
 * that, via a reconciler-convergence poll), it would wait on a `tabs` value
 * that was never going to arrive within any reasonable window — the poll's
 * timeout would elapse, or `hydrateWorkspaceLayout` just wouldn't be called
 * for it at all if gated on "are there tabs yet" (the actual regression this
 * fixes: `restoreSession` used to skip the whole layout restore when the only
 * tabs belonged to a not-yet-reopened database view).
 *
 * So `hydrateWorkspaceLayout` applies the saved split unconditionally and
 * marks whatever panel doesn't have a matching tab YET as protected here,
 * instead of pruning it — same treatment `TabbedArea`'s own reconciler
 * effect gives it (see `syncTabPanels` below). The moment the real tab shows
 * up, it's simply in `live` again and protection is moot. The only way a
 * protected panel is ever removed is a genuine close — of the tab itself, or
 * of its connection (`clearProtectedPanelsForConnection`, called from
 * `useConnections.markDisconnected`) — never "it wasn't in `tabs` at this
 * particular instant", which is the check this whole thing exists to not
 * rely on for these panels.

 * reconciler effect, factored out so `persistedTabs.hydrateWorkspaceLayout`
 * can call the exact same panel-creation logic as a recovery path.
 *
 * That recovery path matters because it's the one case where this can't rely
 * on the reconciler's *own* `useEffect` to converge on its own: at launch,
 * `fromJSON` runs inside `TabbedArea.onReady`, before the reconciler effect
 * has ever fired for this mount — so a failed restore there is naturally
 * cleaned up by the reconciler's first-ever run right after. During an
 * environment switch the inner dockview is already mounted and the
 * reconciler has already been converging tabs → panels throughout the
 * reconnect, so a `fromJSON` failure at that point leaves nothing else
 * scheduled to rebuild the layout — see the call site for why it invokes
 * this directly instead of waiting on the effect.
