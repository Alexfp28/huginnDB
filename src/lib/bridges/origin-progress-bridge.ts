/**
 * The backend's per-secret progress event while a shared-origin document is
 * being published.
 *
 * A separate event from `huginndb://import-progress` even though the payload is
 * identical, and for the reason the Rust side gives at
 * `ORIGIN_PUBLISH_PROGRESS_EVENT`: an event whose name says "import", emitted by
 * a publish, is a wire contract that lies — and a window doing both at once
 * could never tell the two apart.
 *
 * The reason either exists is the same, though: encrypting a secret is
 * deliberately slow (PBKDF2 at 600 000 iterations), so a document publishing a
 * dozen passwords takes long enough that a determinate bar beats a spinner.
 * Nothing is emitted when every envelope travels verbatim — which is the common
 * case, and the one that is instant.
