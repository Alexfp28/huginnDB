/**
 * The backend's per-item import progress event.
 *
 * Seven of the eight `huginndb://…` events already had a module here; this one
 * did not, so both import dialogs declared the name and the payload shape
 * themselves — two copies of a wire contract, in components.
 *
 * Decrypting a secret is deliberately slow (PBKDF2 at 600k iterations), so a
 * bundle of any size takes long enough that a determinate bar beats a spinner.
 * That is the only reason the event exists.
