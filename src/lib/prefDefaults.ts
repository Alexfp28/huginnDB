/**
 * "Has this setting moved off its default, and what does putting it back
 * look like?" — the pure half of the Preferences dialog's changed markers.
 *
 * A `PrefId` is already a `<group>.<key>` path into `Preferences` (see
 * `lib/prefId.ts`), so every row that passes one can answer the question with
 * no extra wiring: read the path out of the live prefs and out of the defaults
 * and compare. What this module adds is the decision of which rows *should*
 * answer it:
 *
 * - **Only the groups that are taste, not configuration.** `editor`, `grid`,
 *   `ui`, `notifications`, `connections` and `pulse` hold knobs with a
 *   meaningful stock value. `ai` does not: its endpoint, model and trust
 *   describe the user's own infrastructure, and a "reset" that blanks the
 *   model or re-points the panel at Ollama's default port would be a way to
 *   break a working setup with one click, not a way to undo a tweak.
 * - **`ui.language` is excluded.** It is the user's locale rather than a
 *   deviation from anything: every Spanish-speaking user would carry a
 *   permanent "changed" dot on General, and "reset" would switch them to
 *   English.
 * - **Keybindings are excluded** by construction (`keybinding.*` is not a
 *   group here) — the Shortcuts section has its own per-row and global reset.
 *
 * The defaults are a parameter rather than an import so this stays free of the
 * store (and its Tauri imports) and can be tested as plain data.
