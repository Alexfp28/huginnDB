/**
 * How the connection manager's rail lays out its rows: provenance first, then
 * the free-text `group` folders inside it.
 *
 * The rail has two independent grouping axes and they nest in one order only.
 * `group` is a folder the user (or, for a shared profile, the *publisher*) typed;
 * provenance is where the profile came from. A "Producción" the user made and a
 * "Producción" some shared file publishes are not the same folder, and
 * `bucketByGroup` alone would merge them under one header — which is the exact
 * ambiguity this module exists to remove. So provenance wins, and
 * `bucketByGroup` runs on each subset.
 *
 * Only the `shared` scope actually splits: `all` and `local` come back as ONE
 * headerless section, so their layout is byte-for-byte what the rail rendered
 * before this existed. A single origin doesn't need a header either, but it gets
 * one anyway — the header is where the row count and the read-only note live,
 * and hiding it for N=1 would make the rail change shape as origins are added.
 *
 * Pure on purpose: the i18n strings arrive as parameters, so the whole layout is
 * testable without a `t`. Same criterion as "the backend never writes display
 * copy" (gotcha #27).
