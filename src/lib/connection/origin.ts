/**
 * Where a connection profile came from: the user, or a shared origin (#108).
 *
 * A profile carrying an `origin_id` is a local mirror of an entry some shared
 * file publishes. That makes it read-only in the editor, and — the reason this
 * module exists rather than the predicate being re-inlined a fourth time —
 * pointless to delete: `merge_profiles_bundle` matches and inserts by the
 * *published* id (`src-tauri/src/commands/origins.rs`), so a locally deleted
 * mirror comes back identical on the next sync. Removing one for real means
 * removing the origin, which is a different flow with its own notices.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT the same predicate as the `p.origin_id === origin.id`
 * comparisons in `originSync.ts` / `OriginsSection.tsx`: those ask "does *this*
 * origin own it", which is ownership, not provenance. Don't unify them.
 *
 * The field is snake_case because `ConnectionProfile` mirrors a Rust struct with
 * no `rename_all`, while `Origin` and `Environment` do carry one (`originId`).
 * Both conventions coexist on purpose (CLAUDE.md gotcha #14's neighbourhood).
