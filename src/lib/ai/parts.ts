/**
 * The AI panel's message anatomy, and the pure folds that build it.
 *
 * # Why these three part types
 *
 * Roadmap decision D5: the chat UI is built from this repo's own primitives
 * rather than adopting `assistant-ui` or the AI SDK's UI layer — both assume a
 * streaming HTTP server that Tauri does not have, so the adapter cost is paid
 * either way. What *is* adopted is assistant-ui's **message anatomy**: a
 * message is a list of parts, and a part is text, a tool call, or a tool
 * result. Keeping that shape means a later migration is mechanical rather than
 * a rewrite of every renderer.
 *
 * # Why this file is pure
 *
 * Everything here is a function from values to values: no store, no Tauri, no
 * React. The folding of stream deltas into parts is the one piece of the panel
 * with real edge cases — a fence that has not closed yet, a tool result
 * arriving before its call, a delta landing after the turn was cancelled — and
 * a pure reducer is the difference between covering those in Vitest and
 * discovering them against a live model.

 * A configuration database is mostly columns whose *values* are JSON or

 * a 400-character JSON object into the middle of a sentence has produced
 * something unreadable no matter how correct it is. The prompt asks for a fence
 * (`ai::agent::SYSTEM_PROMPT`), and a small model complies some of the time;
 * this is the half that does not depend on compliance, the same argument as
 * gotcha #78's backstop.
 *
 * # What counts, and what deliberately does not
 *
 * Two shapes, both found by matching brackets rather than by regex, because a
 * JSON object is nested and a regex cannot balance:
 *
 * - **Valid JSON** — an object or array that `JSON.parse` accepts. Re-emitted
 *   *pretty-printed*, since the reason it is unreadable is usually that it
 *   arrived on one line.
 * - **A multi-line bracketed block** that is not valid JSON: pseudocode, a
 *   template, JSON with unquoted keys. Kept verbatim and marked `text`, so it
 *   renders as a `<pre>` rather than being highlighted as something it is not.
 *
 * A single-line blob that is not valid JSON stays in the prose. That is the
 * conservative direction: `{}` in a sentence, a mongosh filter mid-explanation
 * (`db.c.find({a: 1})`) or a brace in an error message are all prose, and
 * hoisting them out would break the sentence they belong to.
