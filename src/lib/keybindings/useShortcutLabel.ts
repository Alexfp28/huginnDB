/**
 * The display form of an action's primary binding, for menu items and hints.
 *
 * Safe as a Zustand selector because `getBinding` returns a `string`, which is
 * compared by value — the rule from CLAUDE.md gotcha #1 that the rest of this
 * module has to work around. Returns `undefined` for an unbound action so a
 * caller can render nothing rather than an empty chip.
