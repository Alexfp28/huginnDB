/**
 * Mounts the shared dispatcher on `window`. One listener for the whole app,
 * registered once and never re-registered — a rebind changes what it finds in
 * the index, not who is listening.
 *
 * ⚠️ The index is derived with `useMemo` from the **raw** overrides map, never
 * inside a Zustand selector: `resolveBindings` returns a fresh `Map` on every
 * call, and a selector returning a fresh reference re-renders forever
 * (CLAUDE.md gotcha #1). The six `getBinding` selectors this replaces were
 * only safe because each returned a `string`.
