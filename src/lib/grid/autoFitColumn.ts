/**
 * Rescale a set of content-fitted widths so their total lands exactly on the
 * width available on screen — "fit the columns to the window", the companion to
 * the per-column fit above.
 *
 * The two gestures answer different questions and both are wanted. Fitting to
 * *content* asks "how wide does this column need to be to be readable", and
 * happily overflows: with thirty columns you get a horizontal scrollbar, which
 * is correct, because the alternative is thirty unreadable columns. Fitting to
 * *width* asks "show me the whole row at once" and accepts truncation as the
 * price. Neither is a better default than the other, so neither replaces the
 * other.
 *
 * Proportional in both directions rather than equalising. The content fit is
 * what carries the table's visual hierarchy — an `id` column is narrow because
 * its values are, a `description` is wide because its values are — and dividing
 * the width equally throws that away, giving a boolean column the same room as
 * a paragraph. Scaling preserves the ratio.
 *
 * **Shrinking is water-filling, not a single multiply.** A flat
 * `w * (available / total)` drives the already-narrow columns under `min`,
 * and clamping them afterwards overshoots the target — the clamped columns
 * keep more width than their share, so the total comes out wider than the
 * viewport and the scrollbar the gesture was meant to remove stays. Each pass
 * therefore clamps whatever fell below `min`, removes it from the budget, and
 * rescales only the columns still free to move. It terminates because every
 * pass either clamps at least one column or finishes.
 *
 * When even `min` for every column exceeds what is available, the result is
 * `min` throughout and the grid still scrolls. That is honest: there is no
 * width assignment that fits, and the alternative is columns too narrow to hold
 * a single character.
 *
 * @param natural - Content-fitted widths by column name (from
 *   `computeAutoFitWidths`), which is what keeps the proportions meaningful.
 * @param available - Px the columns may occupy: the scrollport's inner width
 *   less the leading gutter. The caller owns that subtraction because only it
 *   knows which non-data columns are in play.
 * @param min - Floor per column, `MIN_COLUMN_WIDTH`. No maximum: the whole
 *   point when growing is to spend the available width, and `MAX_AUTOFIT_WIDTH`
 *   has already bounded `natural`.
