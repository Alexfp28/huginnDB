/**
 * Responsive density for the data grid's toolbar.
 *
 * The toolbar lives inside a dockview panel the user can drag to any width,
 * so this cannot be a CSS media query: the viewport can be 2560 px wide while
 * the grid's own pane is 400 px. Width is therefore observed on the toolbar
 * element itself.
 *
 * Only a *level* is exposed, never the raw width. Two reasons: the layout has
 * three discrete states, so a re-render per observed pixel during a splitter
 * drag would be waste; and the level is what the toolbar's JSX actually
 * branches on, which keeps the thresholds in one documented place instead of
 * scattered inline comparisons.

 * then insert + import + export + bulk update + row count + fit + view toggle
 * + elapsed time and the gaps between them add up to a little over 900 px.
 * Below `compact` only the search box, a couple of icons and the overflow
 * trigger remain, which needs ~350 px — the 560 px threshold keeps a
