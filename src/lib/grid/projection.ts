/**
 * The query panel's projection, between what the user chose and what goes on
 * the wire.
 *
 * The two differ by the key. The grid addresses every edit by the row's
 * primary key (a document by its `_id` — gotcha #7), so a browse that dropped
 * it would render rows nobody could write to, and would do it silently. The
 * user's choice is stored as they made it; the key columns are added here, at
 * the last moment, so the panel can show them as locked instead of pretending
 * they were picked.
 *
 * - **SQL** sends an inclusion list, the table's key columns first. An
 *   exclusion is meaningless there (no dialect has `SELECT * EXCEPT`) and the
 *   backend rejects one, so a stray one is dropped rather than sent.
 * - **MongoDB** includes `_id` by default in an inclusion, so an inclusion goes
 *   as chosen; an exclusion never names `_id`.
