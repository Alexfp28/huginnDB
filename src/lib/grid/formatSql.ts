/**
 * SQL pretty-printing for cell values, and the driver → dialect map behind it.
 *
 * **This is the only file in the repo that imports `sql-formatter`.** That is
 * deliberate: the package is the one heavy dependency this feature adds, and
 * keeping its import surface to a single module means that if the bundle cost
 * ever stops being acceptable, moving it behind a dynamic `import()` is a
 * one-file change rather than a refactor of the three components that format.
 *
 * Two things about how it is imported are load-bearing:
 *
 * - **`formatDialect` rather than `format`.** `format(sql, { language: "postgresql" })`
 *   takes the dialect as a *string*, which means the string-to-dialect map is
 *   reachable from the entry point and every one of the twenty-odd dialects
 *   (BigQuery, Snowflake, Trino, Hive…) is pulled into the bundle.
 *   `formatDialect` takes the dialect object, so only the five imported below
 *   survive tree-shaking — the package declares `sideEffects: false`, so this
 *   actually works.
 * - **The map is a total `Record<Driver, …>`.** Adding a driver to the union in
 *   `types.ts` becomes a compile error here instead of silently falling back to
 *   generic SQL for the new engine.
