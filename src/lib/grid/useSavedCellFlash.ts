/**
 * "It saved" — a one-shot pulse on the cell a write just landed in.
 *
 * The grid had no success feedback at all. Committing an inline edit ran the
 * `UPDATE`, refetched, and left the cell looking exactly as it did while you
 * were typing; the only way to learn that a write had failed was that a toast
 * appeared, so silence had to be read as success. On a database client that is
 * the wrong default — "did that actually go through?" is the first question
 * after an edit, and the app was answering it with nothing.
 *
 * `animate-brand-flash` is what answers it, and it is worth noting that the
 * token was already there: the visual brief asked for "a short blue pulse on a
 * completed action", `tailwind.config.js` defines it as a single 520ms
 * iteration that leaves nothing behind, and until now the settings screen's
 * scroll-to-preference highlight was its only consumer in the whole app. This
 * is the animation being used for the thing it was designed for.
 *
 * **Keyed by row key, never by the values array or a display index.** The mark
 * is set *after* the save resolves, and every save path refetches on the way
 * through, so by the time this runs the row's values array has been replaced by
 * a new object from the fresh page (gotcha #7's concern, one step further on).
 * The primary-key tuple is the only identity that survives that. A grid with no
 * key — a query result with no identity — simply does not flash, which is
 * correct rather than a gap: it is not editable either.
 *
 * **The field is a path, not a column name**, because the two surfaces that
 * read this disagree about granularity and both are right. The table view
 * paints one cell per top-level column, so a nested `customData.format` edit
 * pulses the `customData` cell — the only thing on screen that contains it.
 * The list view draws that field as its own row and pulses exactly it. Storing
 * the full path lets each answer for itself; storing a column name would have
 * made the list view flash a whole document's worth of fields.
 *
 * One deliberate non-feature: editing a primary-key column changes the row's
 * own key, so the flash lands on a key that no longer exists and nothing
 * pulses. Chasing that would mean guessing which new row used to be the old
 * one, and the write is visibly reflected in the reordered grid anyway.
