/**
 * Everything the app does with a connection intent from the command line.
 *
 * Three entry points, one code path: this window's own startup args
 * (`get_startup_args` in the main window, or the intent stashed for a
 * "New window" by `open_new_window`), and a *second* launch of the app
 * forwarded by the single-instance handler over `huginndb://cli-connect`.
 * All three arrive as the same `StartupArgs`, so `applyConnectionIntent` is the
 * single place that turns one into a live connection.
 *
 * Pulled out of `App.tsx`, where it was ~290 of 820 lines and had nothing to do
 * with the shell it shared a component with. It is a **hook, not a child
 * component**, and that is deliberate: a child's effects mount before its
 * parent's, which would move the CLI effects ahead of the launch-restore
 * sequence whose ordering CLAUDE.md gotchas #8 and #10 pin down. Called from the
 * same position `App` used to declare this code, the effect order is unchanged.
 *
 * The guards that are load-bearing here:
 *
 * - **Second-launch routing is main-window-only.** Both the shared
 *   `pending_cli_connect` buffer and the broadcast `cli-connect` event target
 *   the running instance's main window, which owns the routing decision. If a
 *   secondary window also ran it, a window spawned to satisfy a "new window"
 *   route would boot, re-drain the still-full buffer and route it *again*,
 *   opening a third window nobody asked for (issue #23).
 * - **The listener reads its handler through a ref.** It subscribes once on
 *   mount, so closing over the first render's `handleIncomingConnection` would
 *   freeze `cliConnectDefault` for the session — the same trap Monaco's
 *   `addCommand` has (gotcha #9).
 * - **The startup effect is not gated on `profiles` being non-empty.** An ad-hoc
 *   launch (`--host …`) has to work on a machine with zero saved profiles; the
 *   old guard silently skipped exactly that case.
 * - **A CLI `--password` never reaches the keychain.** It is passed straight to
 *   `connect`, and the ad-hoc profile it creates is `ephemeral`, so it is never
 *   written to `profiles.json`.
 * - **A CLI connect follows its connection into the right environment,
 *   instead of always landing wherever happens to be active.** `profiles.json`
 *   is global, so `--connect-profile`/`--connect-profile-id` can name a
 *   connection that belongs to any environment; `connectToProfile` asks the
 *   backend which environment(s) reference it (`findEnvironmentsForConnection`)
 *   and switches there first when the active one isn't among them. Same helper
 *   backs an ad-hoc launch that turns out to match an already-saved profile
 *   (see below), so both paths get the same environment-following behaviour.
 * - **An ad-hoc launch (`--host`/`--uri`) reuses an existing saved profile with
 *   the same driver/host/port/database/username (or, for a `--uri` launch,
 *   the same connection string) instead of always minting a new ephemeral
 *   one.** Otherwise every CLI launch against a server the user already has
 *   saved piles up a fresh throwaway profile alongside it. Only non-ephemeral
 *   profiles are candidates — matching against another launch's throwaway
 *   would only ever match within the same still-running session, and never
 *   after a restart.
 *
 * Failures surface as Console entries rather than toasts: a CLI launch is often
 * unattended, and the Console is where the user goes to find out what happened.
