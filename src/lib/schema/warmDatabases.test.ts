/**
 * `warmDatabases`' honesty about what it actually loaded.
 *
 * `useSchema.refresh` records its failure on the slice rather than throwing, so
 * `loaded += 1` used to run for a database whose table list had failed —
 * nineteen loaded, nineteen broken, reported as a clean success. And every
 * non-limit failure was reduced to `skipped += 1` with the error itself
 * dropped, so a server that had gone away produced a counter and nothing that
 * said why. See gotcha #68.
