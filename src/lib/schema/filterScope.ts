/**
 * What the tree's filter box is currently searching, as one value.
 *
 * The panel used to have two *implicit* scopes and no way to see either:
 * `useUi.selectedConnectionId` decided which connection the needle reached
 * (`ConnectionsTree` passed `""` to every other one), and `MultiDbExplorer`'s
 * local `activeDatabaseName` narrowed it further to whichever database had been
 * expanded last. Neither was announced, and both moved on their own — opening a
 * tab or picking a table from the command palette changes the selected
 * connection, so the box quietly started searching somewhere else.
 *
 * A `FilterScope` replaces both. It is explicit (the user sets it), visible (a
 * chip inside the box says so) and reversible (the chip's ✕, Backspace on an
 * empty box, Escape, or the connection going away). `selectedConnectionId` goes
 * back to meaning only "where tabs and the editor point", which is the one
 * thing it always meant well.
 *
 * Everything here is pure so the rules can be tested without a store or a
 * React tree — in particular the synthetic-child rule, which is the one that
 * decides whether a multi-DB server's tables are inside its own scope.
