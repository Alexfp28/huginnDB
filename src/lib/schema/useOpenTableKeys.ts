/**
 * "Is this table the active tab?" / "is this table open in any tab?", as one
 * derivation over `useTabs` instead of two per-row selectors.
 *
 * `SchemaTableRow` used to call `useTabs((s) => s.tabs.find(...))` and
 * `useTabs((s) => s.tabs.some(...))` itself — each one an O(tabs) scan.
 * Both selectors return a primitive (a string key / a boolean), so neither
 * one breaks CLAUDE.md gotcha #1 on its own, and neither one re-renders a
 * row that isn't affected. What they don't avoid is *running*: 500 rows ×
 * two O(tabs) scans is 1,000 iterations on every `useTabs` write — and
 * `updateQuery` (typing in the SQL editor) is exactly such a write, once per
 * keystroke.
 *
 * `useOpenTableKeys` computes both answers in a single pass over `tabs`,
 * called once per render of whichever explorer renders the table list — not
 * once per row — and hands down a `Set<string>` (`openTableKeys`) rows
 * check with `.has()` instead of scanning `tabs` themselves. The set is a
 * *new* reference whenever `tabs` changes, but that's fine: it's rebuilt
 * once regardless of row count, and a table row's own membership check
 * (`openTableKeys.has(tableTabKey(...))`) is what actually feeds each row's
 * `memo()` — as long as that key's membership hasn't flipped, the row's own
 * `isOpen`/`isActive` props stay the same primitive booleans they were,
 * which is what lets `TableRow`'s memo (CLAUDE.md gotcha #28) keep bailing
 * out for every row except the one that actually changed.
