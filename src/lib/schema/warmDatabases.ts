/**
 * Bounded, on-demand loading of a multi-database server's table lists, so the
 * command palette and the schema tree's filter can search tables the user has
 * never expanded.
 *
 * The palette indexes `useSchema.byConnection`, which for a server-wide
 * connection (`profile.database === ""`) starts out holding only the *database*
 * list: each database's tables arrive under its own `<parent>::db::<name>` slice
 * and only once something opens that view. So a freshly connected multi-DB
 * server had nothing for `@` to find — the tables existed, the index didn't.
 *
 * Why this is a deliberate, user-triggered action rather than an automatic
 * fan-out on every keystroke: **each database view is a whole separate
 * connection pool**. The schema explorer learned this the hard way — its
 * cross-database search used to start every database at once, and a server with
 * nineteen databases turned one keystroke into nineteen simultaneous connection
 * attempts, which was itself enough to exhaust a shared server's limit. It then
 * learned it a second time: bounding that fan-out to three at a time made it
 * survivable but left typing in charge of opening pools, which is the thing the
 * connections-tree redesign finally removed. The shape of the fix is here —
 * `DB_VIEW_WARM_CONCURRENCY` at a time, and a hard stop the moment the server
 * says it is full, because every remaining database would fail identically —
 * and `warmForSearch` is the tree's entry point into it.

 * Every `openDatabaseView` is a separate connection pool against the same
 * server, so an unbounded fan-out is indistinguishable from a denial-of-service
 * against a database the user shares with their IDE, their application backend
 * and any MCP sidecars — a nineteen-database server firing nineteen at once was
 * itself enough to exhaust a shared limit (1.13.0). Three keeps a warm feeling
 * responsive on a handful of databases while making that case a queue rather
 * than a burst.
 *
 * **There used to be two schedulers, and now there is one.** The schema
 * explorer had its own: a re-entrant effect that re-derived its queue on every
 * pass, so a keystroke, a newly active database or a changed visible set
 * changed what still got warmed, and the tree filled in progressively. That
 * behaviour was worth keeping only for as long as *typing* was what triggered
 * the warm — which is precisely what the connections-tree redesign removed
 * (`warmForSearch`). With the warm now a deliberate, one-shot action over a
 * list the tree already computed, the re-entrant version has nothing left to
 * re-derive, and the reason the two could not be merged went with it.
