/**
 * How many things each connection's subtree matches, for the filter box's
 * per-row counters.
 *
 * This is what replaces the old model, where the needle went down as a raw
 * string and every explorer re-derived its own answer. Deriving it once, up
 * here, is what makes the three states the tree has to tell apart expressible
 * at all:
 *
 * - **pending** — the connection's own list is still being fetched. A `0` here
 *   would be a lie that lasts as long as the fetch does.
 * - **cold** — a multi-DB server whose per-database table lists have never been
 *   read (they live in `<parent>::db::<db>` child slices that only exist once
 *   something opens that view, gotcha #36). We have not looked, so we do not
 *   say `0`; the row offers to look instead. Typing must never open a pool by
 *   itself — see `warmForSearch`.
 * - **none** — everything visible is loaded and nothing matched. The only state
 *   in which a `0` badge is the truth.
 *
 * The old explorer collapsed all three into one boolean (`prefetching`), and
 * computed it over `cs.databases` *without* the visible-databases subset, while
 * the loop that actually warmed them applied it — so with a subset active it
 * was stuck true forever and the "no matches" line could never appear. The user
 * saw an empty tree and no explanation.
 *
 * Pure, and pure over *inputs the caller already has*: the schema slices come in
 * as a plain record so the hook above (`useTreeMatchCounts`) can hold the app's
 * single wide subscription to `useSchema.byConnection` and this file can be
 * tested with three object literals.
