/**
 * Which window this code is running in.
 *
 * The distinction is load-bearing, not cosmetic. `tab_state.json` is written by
 * the main window *only* (gotchas #8 and #27): a secondary "New window"
 * instance that read or wrote the shared blob would corrupt the main window's
 * session, so every tab-state-aware path has to be gated. Same for the
 * shared-origin sweep and the environment rail.
 *
 * That invariant used to be spelled sixteen different ways —
 * `getCurrentWindow().label === "main"`, its negation, and two copies of a
 * private `isMainWindow()` helper in two different stores, one of them in a file
 * that already had the helper in scope 88 lines above. Sixteen chances to forget
 * the guard on the next tab-state-aware command. Now there is one.
 *
 * Note this is not the only question asked of the window label: a detached tab
 * window carries a `tabwin-<id>` label it parses for its own id, and the Console
 * log bridge uses the label as an event *target* to scope `emit_to` deliveries
 * (gotcha #25). Those read the label for what it says, not for which window it
 * is, and stay as they are.
