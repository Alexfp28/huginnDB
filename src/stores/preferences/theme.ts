 * palette (HuginnDB, Claude, …), the mode is which of its two variants
 * `light-dark()` resolves to (see `applyTheme`/`applyColorScheme` in
 * `lib/themes.ts`). Built-in families are referenced by id and never
 * mutated; editing one auto-forks into a new custom family so the presets
 * stay pristine.
 *
 * CSS variable updates are flushed eagerly inside each action so the
 * UI re-paints synchronously — the persisted localStorage write
 * happens asynchronously via the `persist` middleware.
