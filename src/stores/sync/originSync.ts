/**
 * Background sync of the (global, #108) registered shared origins, and the
 * per-connection notices it produces.
 *
 * Two halves, deliberately kept apart from the connection stores:
 *
 * * **The pull.** `syncAll()` walks the registered origins and calls
 *   `syncOrigin` for each. Runs at launch, on a long interval, and on demand.
 * * **The notices.** A connection that vanished from its origin's file is
 *   surfaced as a persistent, non-blocking entry in `vanished` — the same shape
 *   as `connectionHealth`'s lost-connection flag, and for the same reason: a
 *   background task must never open a modal. There is nobody guaranteed to be
 *   watching, and a `window.confirm` fired mid-query steals the keystroke.
 *
 * Nothing here deletes on its own. The backend only ever reports a
 * disappearance; `adopt` and `retire` are the user acting on it.
 *
 * Selector note (gotcha #1): components read `vanished` / `syncing` raw and
 * derive with `useMemo`.
