/**
 * The registered shared origins (#108), cached for lookup by id.
 *
 * Deliberately separate from `originSync.ts`, which is the *pull* and the
 * notices it produces: that store is guarded by `isMainWindow()` (gotcha #8),
 * holds in-memory decisions the user made, and writes `profiles.json` as it
 * goes. This one only ever reads, so it must also work in a secondary window —
 * the connection manager there needs to name the origin behind a row just as
 * much as the main window does.
 *
 * Why a store and not a hook per consumer: the connection rail and the MCP
 * settings panel both need `origin_id → name`, and a per-consumer fetch is N
 * `list_origins` calls and N versions of the truth. Renaming an origin in
 * Settings has to reach a manager dialog that is already open, which one hook's
 * mount-time fetch can never do.
 *
 * Invalidation is the `huginndb://origins-changed` event, via
 * `lib/bridges/origins-bridge.ts`. `load()` is also called once at startup, for
 * the window that opens before anything has changed.
 *
 * Selector note (gotcha #1): `byId` is built inside `set`, never derived in a
 * selector, so `useOrigins((s) => s.byId)` is reference-stable and
 * `useOriginName` returns a plain string.
