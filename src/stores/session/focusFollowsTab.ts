/**
 * Keep `useUi.selectedConnectionId` following the focused tab.
 *
 * The app had two independent "current" pointers and nothing connecting them:
 * `useUi.selectedConnectionId` — what the workspace points at, and what the tab
 * strip's `+`, the `newQuery` keybinding and the command palette's new-query
 * entry all resolve their target from — and `useTabs.activeId`, the focused tab,
 * which carries its own `connectionId`.
 *
 * Only the *connection* flows wrote the first one (connect, reconnect, the
 * status-bar picker, the workspace picker, environment restore). Opening a tab
 * wrote only the second. So with two connections live, clicking a MySQL table in
 * the schema tree and pressing `+` opened the editor against whichever
 * connection happened to have been connected last — the schema tree never
 * touched the selection at all. Clicking an *already open* tab of the other
 * connection had the same ending, which is the half nobody reported because the
 * tree is where people notice it.
 *
 * `queryTargetFor` could not rescue this by design: it only ever refines
 * *within* the connection it is handed (parent → its `::db::` child) and
 * deliberately discards a focused tab belonging to somebody else.
 *
 * So the fix is not another `setSelected` call at a third call site — the
 * command palette and the Ctrl+Tab switcher already carried one each, which is
 * the shape of a rule that wants to live in one place. Focus *is* the focused
 * tab's connection, derived here, once.
 *
 * Two constraints this has to respect, both of which cost a bug when ignored:
 *
 * - **Always fold through `parentConnectionId`** (gotcha #032).
 *   `selectedConnectionId` must name a real profile: `useConnections.active`
 *   only ever holds top-level ids, and `App.tsx` clears any selection outside
 *   that set and re-selects an arbitrary pool one render later. A tab on a
 *   `<parent>::db::<db>` child would therefore be undone immediately.
 * - **Subscribe to the store, not to dockview.** `onDidActivePanelChange`
 *   already flows into `useTabs.setActive`; hanging this off it as well would be
 *   the second dockview↔store path gotcha #010 exists to forbid.
