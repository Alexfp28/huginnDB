/**
 * Bridges the in-memory `useTabs` + `useSchema.expanded` stores with the
 * on-disk `tab_state.json` so a user's workspace (open tabs, the active
 * tab, expanded schema tree nodes) survives across app restarts on a
 * per-connection basis.
 *
 * Flow:
 *
 *   • On `connect(id)` →
 *       `hydrate(id)` reads the persisted blob (if any), respects the
 *       `restoreTabsOnOpen` UI preference, and replaces `useTabs` /
 *       `useSchema.expanded` for that connection atomically.
 *
 *   • While the connection is open →
 *       a single Zustand subscription on `useTabs` (filtered to the
 *       active connection's tabs) and on `useSchema.byConnection[id]`
 *       debounce-flushes the snapshot to disk 600ms after the last
 *       change.
 *
 *   • On `disconnect(id)` →
 *       `flush(id)` cancels the debounce and writes the latest snapshot
 *       synchronously, then detaches the subscriptions. We deliberately
 *       do NOT clear `useTabs` here — `useConnections.disconnect` calls
 *       `useTabs.closeForConnection` afterwards as before.
 *
 * One snapshot at a time is kept per connection. If the user connects,
 * disconnects, and reconnects in quick succession, we re-hydrate from
 * disk on the second connect — staleness between in-memory and disk
 * is bounded by the debounce window.
 *
 *   • On window close (main window only) →
 *       `flushAllTabState()` (wired from `App.tsx`'s `onCloseRequested`
 *       handler) synchronously saves every still-active connection plus the
 *       session-level workspace layout, bypassing the debounce. Before this
 *       existed, only an explicit `disconnect()` ever flushed synchronously —
 *       a normal window close (let alone a crash) could lose up to
 *       `SAVE_DEBOUNCE_MS` of trailing tab/layout edits.
 *
 * The inner-dockview split/float geometry is NOT per connection: one inner
 * dockview hosts every open connection's tabs, so its geometry is a
 * session-level artifact persisted once (top-level `workspaceLayout` in
 * `tab_state.json`) via `scheduleSaveActive` → `saveWorkspaceLayoutNow`, and
 * restored once at launch via `hydrateWorkspaceLayout`. It used to be
 * duplicated under every connection, which made restore order-dependent.

 *
 * `cancelPendingSaves()` alone (the pre-existing guard, kept below) only
 * drops timers already armed *at the moment it's called* — it does nothing
 * about one armed a tick later. And one reliably gets armed a tick later:
 * `switchTo`'s teardown loop calls `disconnect()` for each outgoing
 * connection, which awaits a real backend IPC round-trip and then runs
 * `markDisconnected` — which drops the connection's schema cache and, for a
 * multi-DB parent, closes its children's tabs. Either can wake another
 * still-subscribed connection's `useTabs`/`useSchema` listener mid-loop, long
 * after the last `cancelPendingSaves()` call, and that timer fires ~600ms
 * later against whichever environment is active by then — the *incoming*
 * one, since `setActiveEnvironment` has since run. The result is exactly the
 * regression `2299f40` fixed once already, just via a path that fix didn't
 * close: a snapshot of the (still transiently empty) tab store overwrites
 * the incoming environment's real, previously-saved tabs.
 *
 * A suspend flag closes every path at once, regardless of what wakes a
 * subscription, instead of chasing individual re-arm sites one at a time.
 *
 * `persistLaunchState` (below) checks the same flag, for the same reason via
 * a sibling path this flag didn't originally cover: `switchTo`'s teardown
 * loop calls `useConnections.disconnect()` for each outgoing connection, and
 * `disconnect()` fires `persistLaunchState` itself (fire-and-forget, never
 * awaited by the loop) with whatever `useUi`/`useTabs` hold *at that instant*
 * — which by then is the nulled-out focus/active-tab/folds/filter that
 * `switchTo` step 2 already cleared, since step 2 runs before the disconnect
 * loop. `switchTo` re-saves the *real* captured values right after the loop,
 * but that write and the loop's fire-and-forget ones are unrelated, unawaited
 * promises with no ordering guarantee between them — if even one straggler
 * from the loop resolves after the real re-save (plausible: it's one
 * `saveLaunchState` IPC round-trip per disconnected connection, racing a
 * single corrective write), it overwrites the good launch state with nulls,
 * and if it resolves after `setActiveEnvironment` too, it corrupts the

 * fresh from disk instead of being skipped as "already done this session". A
