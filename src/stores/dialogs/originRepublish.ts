/**
 * Open state for "publish this correction back to the origin" (the prompt that

 *
 * A store rather than local state in `ConnectionDialog`, for one reason that
 * decides it: the prompt has to outlive the dialog that raises it. Saving keeps
 * the connection dialog open, but *connecting* saves and then closes it, and
 * "fix the password, connect, done" is the flow a rotated credential actually
 * produces. A `useState` in there would take the prompt down with the dialog in
 * exactly the case it matters most.
 *
 * Everything the prompt renders is captured at open time. It names a connection
 * and an origin that the user has, by then, already stopped looking at.
