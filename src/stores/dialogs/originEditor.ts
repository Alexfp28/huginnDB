/**
 * Open state for the shared-origin document editor (#155).
 *
 * Same shape and the same reason as `connectionDialog.ts`: the overlay has more
 * than one entry point — Settings → Origins, the read-only banner in
 * `ConnectionDialog` for a connection an origin publishes, and the republish
 * prompt's conflict hand-off — and a local `useState` in any of them would make
 * it unreachable from the others.
 *
 * Only the *identity* of the document lives here. The draft itself is local
 * state inside `OriginEditorOverlay`: it is a document being composed, not
 * application state, and putting it in a store would invite exactly the thing
 * `origin_doc`'s first invariant forbids — a draft that leaks into (or reads
 * from) this machine's own `profiles.json` / `tab_state.json`.
 *
 * `open` puts aside the workbench it was opened from (`suspend`), because the
 * overlay is a full-screen sibling of it, not a dialog stacked on one, and
 * `close` gives that same surface back (`resume`), saved or not (gotcha #101).
 * The surface is remembered by name rather than by asking every one to resume:
 * which one to reopen is a fact about how the editor was entered, and keeping
 * it here is what makes "only the one that was set aside" hold by construction.
