/**
 * Open state for the three connection-management modals owned by the File menu
 * (`ConnectionDialog`, `ImportProfilesDialog`, `ExportProfilesDialog`).
 *
 * They used to be plain `useState` booleans inside `FileMenu`, which made them
 * unreachable from anywhere else — the command palette needs to offer "New
 * connection…" / "Manage connections…" / "Import profiles…" / "Export
 * profiles…" without reproducing the dialogs (and their onConnected wiring) at
 * a second mount point. Same pattern as `docsDialog` / `feedbackDialog`:
 * `FileMenu` stays the single place that renders them, and any surface can ask
 * for one. The empty workspace's "New connection" button (`EmptyWatermark`)
 * asks here too; it used to mount its own `ConnectionDialog`, which no store
 * could reach — so no full-screen editor could put it aside either.
 *
 * The manager carries a profile *id* rather than the profile object so the
 * caller doesn't have to look one up; `FileMenu` resolves it against the live
 * profile list at render time, which also means a profile deleted between the
 * request and the render simply falls back to a new draft.
 *
 * **A full-screen editor opened from the manager puts it aside, then gives it
 * back** — the same rule as Settings (`useSettingsDialog`, gotcha #101). The
 * manager is a workbench dialog and so is the shared-origin editor its "edit
 * at origin" link opens; stacking one on the other traps focus in whichever
 * mounted last.
 * - `ConnectionDialog` reports the profile it is showing (`focus`), since the
 *   user can move off the one it was opened on.
 * - `suspend()` closes the manager and remembers that profile.
 * - `resume()` reopens it there, but only if `suspend()` was what closed it.
 *   Any explicit open or close supersedes a pending return.
