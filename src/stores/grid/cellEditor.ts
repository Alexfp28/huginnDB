/**
 * Shared "currently editing cell" state for the JetBrains-style side-panel
 * editor. The data grid and the side panel live in different React subtrees
 * (the panel is a split inside `IslandShell`, not a child of the grid's own
 * tab), so a small Zustand store is the clean bridge between "user asked to
 * edit this cell" and "the side panel renders it".
 *
 * The target carries the commit context as an `onSave` callback supplied by
 * the originating tab (the same `onCellSave` closure the modal already uses).
 * It is captured per open-session, so staleness is bounded to one edit — the
 * same contract the modal `CellEditor` relies on.
 *
 * Subscribe with the single-object selector `s => s.target` so the value stays
 * reference-stable between opens (CLAUDE.md gotcha #1).
 *
 * `close()` also hides the docked panel itself (`panelLayout.sideEditorOpen`)
 * — before the outer-shell redesign the panel was a dockview group with its
 * own close button, so clearing `target` alone left an empty-but-visible
 * panel for the user to dismiss separately; now the split's visibility IS
 * `sideEditorOpen`, so leaving it untouched here made every discard/save/tab-
 * closed path (all of which route through `close()`) unable to actually
 * dismiss the panel.
