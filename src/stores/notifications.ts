/**
 * In-memory history of the notifications this window has raised.
 *
 * Why a history exists at all: the toasts are deliberately short-lived, and the
 * only thing that makes short-lived acceptable is that nothing is lost by
 * missing one. A notification that named a file, an error worth copying or a
 * count worth checking stays reachable from the bell in the status bar
 * (`NotificationCenter`) for the rest of the session.
 *
 * Three properties are load-bearing:
 *
 * * **In memory, never on disk.** This is session ephemera, not user content:
 *   it does not deserve a state file (see the on-disk state map in CLAUDE.md),
 *   and it must not ride in `prefs.json`, which is rewritten on every
 *   `Ctrl`+wheel of the grid. `historyLimit` is the only part that persists.
 * * **Per window.** Every store instance belongs to one webview, which is
 *   already how notifications work — a command's log entries are emitted to the
 *   window that ran it (gotcha #25). No `emit`/`listen` here: a second window
 *   inheriting the main window's history would be claiming it did work it never
 *   did.
 * * **Grouped like the toast.** A burst of identical notifications is one
 *   entry with a count, exactly as it appeared on screen, because that is what
 *   the user is trying to recognise when they open the panel.
 *
 * `entries` is a plain array on the state; derive anything else (the unread
 * count, per-day sections) with `useMemo` in the component — a selector that
 * filtered or grouped here would return a fresh array on every call and trip
 * the infinite-re-render trap in CLAUDE.md gotcha #1.
