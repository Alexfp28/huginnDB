/**
 * Open/close + active-section state for the Settings dialog.
 *
 * Lives in its own tiny store so `ViewMenu`, `ThemeMenu`, the keyboard
 * shortcut handler (`Ctrl/Cmd+,`), and the topbar button can all open the
 * dialog without prop-drilling through `App.tsx`.
 *
 * **A full-screen editor opened from Settings puts it aside, then gives it
 * back.** Settings is a workbench dialog, and so are the shared-origin and
 * policy editors. Stacking one workbench on another traps focus in whichever
 * mounted last, so the editors are siblings of Settings (mounted in `App`),
 * never its children.
 * - Opening an editor calls `suspend()`, which closes Settings and remembers
 *   the section it was on. It reports whether it did, so the origin editor —
 *   which can also be opened from the connection dialog — knows which surface
 *   to give back (`stores/dialogs/originEditor.ts`).
 * - Closing an editor calls `resume()`, which reopens Settings on that
 *   section, but only if `suspend()` was what closed it.
 *
 * So an editor reached from somewhere else (a connection's banner) leaves
 * Settings closed on the way out, as it found it.
