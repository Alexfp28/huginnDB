/**
 * The app's one confirm dialog, replacing `window.confirm` — see
 * `lib/confirmDestructive.ts` and `stores/dialogs/confirmRequest.ts`.
 *
 * Mounted once per window (`App.tsx`, `shell/DetachedTabWindow.tsx` —
 * required, since `TableDataTab`/`DocumentListView` call `confirmDestructive`
 * from there too — and `pulse/PulseWindow.tsx`), the same way `ConfirmDialog`
 * itself is used, not shared as a singleton across windows: each renders its
 * own against the one `useConfirmRequest` store that exists per window.
 *
 * Deliberately has no `submitting` state of its own. `window.confirm` was
 * synchronous and blocked the caller until it returned; a Promise does not,
 * so the temptation is to `await` inside here and disable the buttons while
 * that runs. Don't — the caller does its own work *after* this resolves
 * (see the ten call sites this replaces), which is exactly the shape
 * `useAsyncSubmit`'s deliberate "stay busy after success" (gotcha #44)
 * depends on; a host that manages its own busy state would race it instead.
