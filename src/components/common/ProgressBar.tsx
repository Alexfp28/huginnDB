/**
 * A determinate progress bar with a caption underneath.
 *
 * Was `connection/dialogs/ImportProgressBar`, private to the two import
 * wizards. It moved here the moment a third surface needed it — publishing a
 * shared origin's document (#155) — which is exactly the criterion gotcha #28
 * sets for `common/`: cross-domain, and a leaf.
 *
 * The reason a determinate bar exists at all, rather than a spinner, is the same
 * in both places: the work is one 600 000-iteration PBKDF2 derivation per
 * secret, deliberately slow, and a file with a dozen of them takes long enough
 * that "something is happening" is not enough feedback. The caption is a prop
 * because the *unit* differs — profiles being imported, connections being
 * encrypted — while the bar does not.
