/**
 * One connection row of `ConnectionsTree`, plus the subtree it expands into.
 *
 * Extracted out of `ConnectionsTree.renderConnection`, which returned this
 * exact JSX from a plain function CALLED per row (`renderConnection(p)`),
 * not rendered as `<renderConnection />` — so there was never a component
 * boundary here at all. Every row's JSX was reconciled as part of
 * `ConnectionsTree`'s own render pass, which means React could never bail
 * out of diffing it, no matter how little a given row actually changed. As
 * an actual `memo()`-wrapped component, a row now CAN skip re-rendering
 * when its own props are unchanged — see CLAUDE.md gotcha #28.
 *
 * The prop signature is wide (a whole `ConnectionMatchSummary`, a callback
 * bundle) rather than narrowed to primitives the way `SchemaTableRow` is —
 * deliberately: a connections list is dozens of rows, not the hundreds a
 * table list can be, so the payoff of chasing primitive props here is much
 * smaller than the `SchemaTableRow` fix earns. `actions` is grouped into one
 * bundle (the `TableActions` precedent) so a new affordance is one prop to
 * add, not eight.
 *
 * `actions` is a REF, not a plain object — the same `interactiveRef` /
 * `rowCallbacksRef` pattern `DataGrid`/`GridRow` already use, and
 * `DocumentListView`'s `callbacksRef`/`actionsRef` from the list-view memo
 * fix. `handleRowClick`/`handleDisconnect`/`handleReconnect` close over
 * several other per-render closures in `ConnectionsTree` (`filterFolds`,
 * `setCollapsed`, `matchCounts`, …) that are not themselves memoized, so a
 * `useCallback` for any of them would either go stale (an incomplete
 * dependency array silently calling last render's `matchCounts`) or gain no
 * stability at all (an exhaustive one, since most of those deps change
 * often) — a ref sidesteps the question entirely: it's rebuilt fresh every
 * `ConnectionsTree` render like the handlers themselves, but the REF OBJECT
 * `ConnectionTreeRow` receives never changes identity, so its `memo()` never
 * sees it as a changed prop.
