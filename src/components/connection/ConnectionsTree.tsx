/**
 * The Schema panel's top two levels: folder → connection (#107).
 *
 * Before this, the panel showed the schema of whichever connection was selected
 * elsewhere, so browsing a second server meant leaving the tree to pick it from
 * a menu. Now every saved connection is a row here, grouped by its folder, and
 * expanding one renders its existing schema subtree underneath — database →
 * tables for a multi-DB connection, schema → tables for a single-DB one.
 *
 * Two things are reused rather than reinvented. Folders come from
 * `bucketByGroup` + `useConnectionGroupCollapse`, the same pair the File menu,
 * the connections manager dialog and the status bar use, so the initial fold
 * state and the `connectionGroupExpandMode` preference behave identically in
 * all of them — but each surface keeps its own session-local overrides after
 * that, so folding a folder in the connections manager while this tree is
 * open no longer folds it here too. The subtree is the same
 * `SchemaExplorer` the panel rendered before — it lost its panel-level title,
 * icon strip and scroll container, since the row above it now owns all three
 * (its right-click menu is [[ConnectionActionsMenu]], its neighbour here).
 *
 * Expansion defaults to "expanded when connected" and only the user's folds are
 * stored (`LaunchState.collapsedConnections`, per environment). Keeping the
 * default derived rather than persisted is what stops the tree from ever claiming
 * a row is open over a subtree that doesn't exist: a remembered fold can only
 * ever mean "show this folded when it comes back".
 *
 * **This file owns the search.** The filter box used to hand a raw string down
 * to whichever connection happened to be selected and `""` to every other one,
 * so with two connections open one filtered and the other did not, and nothing
 * on screen said why — the only marker of "selected" is a hairline on the row,
 * and the selection moves on its own when a tab opens. Now the needle is
 * committed once (`useTreeSearch`), counted once against every live connection
 * (`useTreeMatchCounts`), and what travels down to the explorers is the parsed
 * `patterns` array plus that connection's already-computed summary. A row with
 * no matches folds to one dimmed line with a `0` badge instead of silently
 * showing its whole tree.
 *
 * The fold a filter causes is **visual and ephemeral**: it never touches
 * `collapsedConnections`, because that set goes through `persistLaunchState`
 * and a search would otherwise leave permanent folds the user never asked for.
 * The chevron still works, as a session-local override for as long as the
 * filter lasts.
