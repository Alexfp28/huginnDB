/**
 * The one confirmation for deleting saved connections — a single profile from
 * the editor's Delete button, a checked batch from the rail, or every local
 * connection at once.
 *
 * It replaced two different confirmations that used to coexist: a native
 * `window.confirm` for the single delete and an in-app `ConfirmDialog` for the
 * bulk one. Neither said what a delete actually takes with it, which is the
 * point of this component: `delete_profile` also drops the OS-keychain entries,
 * the connection's tabs and "databases to show" filter **in every environment**,
 * and any JSON Schema bindings pinned to its columns. The list is built from
 * what applies to these targets — SQLite keeps no password, an untunnelled
 * profile keeps no SSH secret — because an enumeration that is right about the
 * actual rows reads as information, and a fixed one reads as boilerplate.
 *
 * ## Mount it conditionally
 *
 * There is no `open` prop, and that is deliberate. `useAsyncSubmit` leaves
 * `submitting` true after a success, because its contract assumes the success
 * path unmounts the dialog (gotcha #44). Here the *parent* — the connection
 * manager — stays open, so a hook living up there would be stuck for every
 * later delete. Rendering this only while there are targets makes the unmount
 * the reset.
 *
 * Profiles a shared origin publishes never reach here: the rail cannot check
 * them and "all local" excludes them by definition. That is not this
 * component's guard to enforce — deleting one is a no-op the next sync undoes,
 * so the refusal belongs at the boundary, in the backend.
