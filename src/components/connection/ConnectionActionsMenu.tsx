/**
 * Right-click menu for a connection, wrapping whatever row represents it.
 *
 * These actions used to be an icon strip in the explorer's header. Once the
 * explorer became a subtree of the connections tree (#107) that strip repeated
 * under every expanded connection — five icons and a filter box each — so it
 * moved here, where a connection's actions belong: on the connection.
 *
 * It used to live inside `SchemaExplorer.tsx` "because everything it drives is
 * already there" — which was true only while the dialogs and the
 * export/import/security helpers were private to that file. They are now their
 * own modules, so the menu lives with the tree that renders it (its only
 * consumer, `ConnectionsTree`, was reaching across into `schema/` for it).
 *
 * What's offered is driver- and mode-aware, and the distinctions are the same
 * ones the two explorers already encoded: `CREATE DATABASE` is Postgres/MySQL
 * only, create-collection is MongoDB's stand-in for it, whole-database `.sql`
 * export/import needs exactly one target database (so never in multi-DB mode),
 * and the visible-databases subset only means anything when there are several.
 *
 * Connect/disconnect are delegated: the tree owns what those do to focus and to
 * its expansion overrides, and duplicating that here would let the two drift.

   * Open this connection in its own window, already connected.

   * Zero backend: `open_new_window` has always taken an optional
   * `StartupArgs` intent, stores it per window label, and the secondary window
   * drains it on boot via `take_window_startup_intent` (`useCliIntents`). This
   * just supplies the intent the CLI path already supplies.
   *
   * **No second pool is opened.** `AppState` is per *process* and shared
   * across windows, and `connect_inner`'s early return is idempotent — its own
   * comment names this exact scenario — so connecting to a profile the main
   * window already has open reuses that pool: no second endpoint reservation,
   * no second SSH tunnel. Each window shows as active only what it opened
   * itself, because the frontend deliberately does not listen to
   * `huginndb://connection-opened` (see `connection-sync-bridge.ts`, issue
   * #50). Two inherited consequences, neither introduced here: a `disconnect`
   * in any window closes the pool for all of them, and closing the secondary
   * leaves a pool it alone opened alive until the app exits — the CLI path
   * behaves the same way.
   *
   * Nothing here touches `tab_state.json`: every writer sits behind
   * `isMainWindow()` (gotcha #8), including the non-obvious path where
   * `connectToProfile` reaches `useEnvironments.switchTo`. Note that if the
   * frontend ever did start listening to `-connection-opened`, the main
   * window would adopt this connection and its next `persistLaunchState`
   * would write it into the environment's launch state — at which point this
   * gesture would begin altering what the app reopens at boot.
