/**
 * Shared single-line cell input used both by the inline INSERT draft row
 * and by inline cell editing (double-click on an existing cell).
 *
 * It renders a monospace text field plus one optional affordance: an "expand"
 * button that escalates to the full Monaco editor (shown when `onExpand` is
 * provided). There used to be a second, a "∅" button that forced the cell to
 * NULL directly from the inline field — removed as too easy to hit by
 * accident for what it does; clearing a value to NULL is still reachable from
 * the expand editor, which asks for it deliberately rather than as a
 * one-click slip.
 *
 * Commit / cancel wiring is opt-in: when `onCommit` / `onCancel` are given the
 * field commits on Enter and on blur, and cancels on Esc. The draft row leaves
 * them undefined because it owns keyboard / blur handling at the row level.
 *
 * The expand button calls `preventDefault` on mousedown so clicking it never
 * blurs the input first — which would otherwise trigger a premature commit in
 * inline-edit mode.
 *
 * **The affordance lives inside the field's box, not beside it.** It used to
 * be a flex sibling of a bordered `<input>`, painting its own opaque
 * `bg-background` so that `sticky` had something to sit on. Against a tinted
 * row — hover, selection, the draft row's own wash — that is a hard-edged pale
 * rectangle butted up against a rounded, focus-haloed field, which is the seam
 * this component was reported for. Now the wrapper carries the border and the
 * focus treatment (`fieldFocus("focus-within")`, the variant `styles.ts`
 * documents for exactly this shape), the input is transparent inside it, and
 * the button shares the field's own surface so there is nothing to seam
 * against. It stays `sticky` so a very wide column doesn't scroll it away.
 *
 * **The expand button is hand-rolled, not `IconButton`, and that is
 * deliberate.** `IconButton`'s smallest shape is a fixed 24px square —
 * exactly this field's own total height (`h-6`), so nesting one inside
 * leaves it no room to breathe: it touches the field's top and bottom edges
 * with nothing left for the rounded border to show around it. Same wall
 * `DocumentListView`'s inline field actions hit (see its own note on the
 * primitive layer's density floor) — this field is that same class of
 * control, just a row taller. What it keeps from the primitive is the themed
 * tooltip (`SimpleTooltip`, not a native `title=`), sized by its own padding
 * instead of a fixed box.
