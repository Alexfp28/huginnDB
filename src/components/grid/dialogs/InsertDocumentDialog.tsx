/**
 * Write a MongoDB document by hand and insert it.
 *
 * The gap this closes: a collection is schemaless, but every insert path the
 * app had was shaped like a SQL row. The draft row (and its list-view twin,
 * `DraftDocumentCard`) iterates the *columns the grid discovered*, which are
 * sampled from one page of documents — a description of what those documents
 * happened to contain, not of what a document may contain. A field the sample
 * did not show could not be typed at all. The only way to insert an arbitrary
 * document was "Import JSON", which opens a file picker: fine for a bulk load,
 * absurd for adding one record.
 *
 * So the two paths are complementary and both stay. The draft row is faster
 * when the shape is already right, which is the common case; this is for when
 * it is not.
 *
 * **The frontend does not parse what is typed here.** The text crosses the IPC
 * boundary as source and is read by `shell::parse_relaxed_value`, the same Rust
 * parser the query editor and the aggregation builder use (gotcha #33). That is
 * what lets a document pasted out of a shell session — `ObjectId(…)`,
 * `ISODate(…)`, `NumberLong(…)`, unquoted keys, single quotes, trailing commas,
 * comments — mean here exactly what it means everywhere else. A `JSON.parse`
 * here would reject most of that outright and, worse, would quietly narrow a
 * `NumberLong` that fits in an `Int32` (gotcha #29's trap).
 *
 * `PipelineEditor` rather than the JSON cell editor for the same reason: it
 * renders the `mongodb-pipeline` language, whose Monarch grammar knows those
 * constructors and whose completions offer them. A `json`-mode editor would
 * red-squiggle every valid `ObjectId(…)` in the box. Its `completion` entry is
 * pointed at this collection, so the field names already in it are suggested
 * while typing — the closest thing a schemaless store has to a column list.
 *
 * An array of documents is accepted too, and inserted with `insert_many`.
 * That falls out of the parser accepting one, and it is what makes pasting the
 * output of a `find()` work.
