/**
 * Paste JSON rows into a SQL table.
 *
 * The SQL sibling of `InsertDocumentDialog`, closing a different gap. That one
 * exists because a MongoDB collection is schemaless and the grid's column set
 * is only a sample of it, so a field the sample missed could not be typed at
 * all. A SQL table has no such problem — the server enforces its columns, and
 * the draft row can already reach every one of them.
 *
 * What SQL was missing is **bulk**. The draft row commits one row per
 * `insert_row` call, so "here are forty rows from a spreadsheet" had no path
 * short of hand-writing an `INSERT` in the query editor. Paste an array here
 * and it becomes one multi-row statement inside one transaction.
 *
 * **The frontend does not parse what is typed here**, the same rule the Mongo
 * dialog follows (gotcha #33): the text crosses IPC as source and Rust decides
 * what it means. That is not merely symmetry — the backend is where the
 * catalogue is, and the catalogue is what turns a pasted key into a column name
 * safely (gotcha #4) and what decides whether a JSON `true` is `1` or the word.
 * A `JSON.parse` here could report a syntax error slightly sooner and would
 * still have to defer every question that matters.
 *
 * Monaco in `json` mode rather than the Mongo dialog's `PipelineEditor`: here
 * the grammar really is strict JSON, there is no `ObjectId(…)` to keep from
 * being red-squiggled, and the bundled JSON worker gives syntax validation for
 * free.
