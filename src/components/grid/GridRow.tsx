 *
 * - **Identity comes from `rowValues`, never a display index** (CLAUDE.md
 *   gotcha #7). TanStack's `row.index` is the *filtered* index while the parent
 *   resolves primary keys against the unfiltered backend page, and the two
 *   diverge the moment a client filter is non-trivial.
 * - **`callbacksRef` is a ref on purpose.** `DataGrid`'s local helpers are
 *   plain function declarations recreated on every render — including the very
 *   clicks this memo exists to make cheap — so passing them as props would hand
 *   every row a changed prop every time and defeat the memo outright.

/**
 * One `<tr>` of the data grid, including its per-cell context menus.
 *
 * Split out of `DataGrid`'s render body and wrapped in `React.memo` because
 * every interactive grid state (`selectedRowIndex`, `activeCell`,
 * `selectedCell`, `inlineEdit`, `fkEditCell`) used to live inline in
 * `DataGrid`, so a single click re-ran the render function for the WHOLE
 * table — every visible row × every column, each cell wrapping its own
 * `<ContextMenu>` — regardless of how many rows the click actually affected.
 * The cost scales with total visible cells, which is why clicking through a
 * 15-column table felt noticeably slower than a 5-column one at the same row
 * count, even though the click only ever changes one or two rows' worth of
 * state. `GridRow` receives only state that's already been narrowed to
 * "does this concern THIS row" by the caller (below), so React's shallow
 * prop comparison lets it bail out for every row except the (at most two)
 * whose selection / active-cell / inline-edit status actually changed.
 *
 * `callbacksRef` mirrors the `interactiveRef` pattern the `columns` cell
 * definitions already use above: `openCellEdit`, `copyToClipboard`, and the
 * other locally-declared helpers are plain function declarations recreated
 * on every `DataGrid` render — including the very clicks this component
 * exists to make cheap — so passing them as ordinary props would hand every
 * row a "changed" prop every time and defeat the memoization outright.
 * Reading them through a ref that's refreshed each render (not compared by
 * `memo`) keeps `GridRow` seeing the latest closures without their identity
 * forcing a re-render. Everything else below (column metadata, `onCellSave`
 * and friends) comes from the parent tab and — verified against `columns`'s
 * own `useMemo` deps above — stays referentially stable across a plain grid
 * click, so it's passed straight through as ordinary props.
