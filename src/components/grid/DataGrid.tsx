/**
 * Generic data grid used for both table data and ad-hoc query results.
 * Built on top of TanStack Table; the table view's rows are windowed by
 * `@tanstack/react-virtual` (list view — MongoDB's `DocumentListView` — is
 * not, see its own file).
 *
 * Visual features:
 * - Numeric columns (int, float, decimal, …) are highlighted in amber.
 * - Clicking a row selects it (blue tint); clicking a cell opens the
 *   compact `CellPreview` panel at the bottom-right of the container.
 * - Double-clicking a cell opens the full Monaco `CellEditor` for
 *   multi-line viewing and, when editable, saving.
 *
 * Interaction features (when `editable`):
 * - Right-click on a cell shows a HeidiSQL-style context menu with
 *   copy / set-null / filter / row ops (insert, duplicate, delete).
 * - Server-side column filters render as removable chips above the
 *   grid. The pre-existing client text filter sits next to them and
 *   keeps acting on the current page only.

   * mode, the NULL placeholder, the `truncateLongTextAt` cap) is replayed
   * here, so the fit matches the rendered text and not the raw value.
   *
   * Scope is the rows currently in the grid (`visibleRows`, i.e. the fetched
   * page after the client filter), matching HeidiSQL: fitting to rows the
   * user can't see would need a full-table scan per double-click.
