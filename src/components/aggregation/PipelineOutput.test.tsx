/**
 * @vitest-environment jsdom
 *
 * The aggregation preview's own "expand every nested object".
 *
 * It exists as a separate test because this surface is the one place the list
 * view is mounted *without* a `DataGrid` around it: there is no footer here to
 * hang the gesture on, so `PipelineOutput` owns the `ExpandAllSignal` itself.
 * That wiring is what can rot independently of the grid's — the shared piece
 * (what a card does with an epoch) is covered next door in
 * `grid/DocumentListView.test.tsx`.
 *
 * Mounted under `StrictMode`, exactly as `main.tsx` does, for the reason ADR
 * gotcha #85 records: a component that adjusts state during render behaves
 * differently when the body runs twice, and the version of this feature that
 * shipped broken passed every non-strict test.
