/**
 * The last thing between a draft and everyone who pulls from the origin.
 *
 * A `ConfirmDialog` rather than a toast-and-hope, for the reason gotcha #44
 * gives: a failure has to say why *in* the dialog, which stays open, so the user
 * can fix it and try again without losing the draft. The impact report is
 * rendered inside it rather than only in the pane behind it — a preview the user
 * has to remember from another screen is a preview they did not read.
