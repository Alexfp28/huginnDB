/**
 * Keeps the OS window title (taskbar / Alt-Tab entry) in sync with what the
 * window is actually showing, so multiple HuginnDB windows are tellable apart
 * from outside the app (#59) and the active table's database + name is always
 * visible (#57).
 *
 * Renders nothing — it is a side-effect-only component mounted once per window.
 * Runs in EVERY window (not main-only): each window has its own title, and a
 * secondary window is exactly the case #59 is about. `setTitle` is guarded in a
 * try/catch because it is an async IPC call whose permission is capability-
 * scoped; a failure must never break rendering.
 *
 * Title shape:
 *   "<profile> · <db>.<table> — HuginnDB"   when a table tab is active
 *   "<profile> · <db> — HuginnDB"           when another tab / connection is focused
 *   "HuginnDB"                              when nothing is connected
