/**
 * Launch splash — the one screen in the app that is allowed to be pure brand:
 * the sticker mark, large, over a halftone wash and a blue bloom on the dark
 * (or light) app surface. Per the visual brief it must be *brief*, so it is on
 * screen for roughly a third of a second and then fades out over another fifth.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a second Tauri window: a real splash window would have to be
 * created, positioned and closed around webview startup (and on Windows that
 * means an `async fn` command building a `WebviewWindow` — see gotcha #19),
 * which is a lot of moving parts for half a second of paint. This is a plain
 * overlay inside the existing window, mounted at the top of the app tree.
 *
 * It is also intentionally decoupled from the launch sequence (reconnect →
 * layout → focus, gotchas #8 and #10): it neither waits for it nor blocks it.
 * Gating a purely decorative overlay on session restore would mean a slow
 * reconnect keeps the user staring at a logo, and a failure could leave the
 * overlay up forever. It runs on its own timer and gets out of the way.
