/**
 * The collapsible header of a group inside a picker list: chevron, optional
 * icon, label, and a muted `(count)`, filling the rest of its line.
 *
 * Settings' three connection pickers (`AiConnectionTree`, `McpConnectionTree`,
 * `PulseConnectionTree`) each wrote this out twice — once for a provenance
 * section, once for a group folder inside it — as six copies of the same
 * `<button>`. Three consumers is what gotcha #60 asks for before a primitive
 * exists, and six copies of a markup nobody would think to keep in sync is the
 * reason it should.
 *
 * It is the *button*, not the whole header line. What sits beside it — each
 * tree's select-all checkbox, with its own handler and its own wording — and
 * the line's chrome (the section band, the group's indent) stay at the call
 * site, the same split `tree-row.tsx` makes: the primitive owns what is
 * identical and nothing that differs.
 *
 * `open` drives both the chevron and `aria-expanded`. The hand-written copies
 * had the chevron and no `aria-expanded`, so a screen reader heard six plain
 * buttons with no hint that each one hides a list.
