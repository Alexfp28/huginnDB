/**
 * One entry of a workbench's left rail: icon, a label and an optional one-line
 * description, with the active entry drawn as a brand-tinted pill.
 *
 * Settings and the shared-origin editor each wrote this out by hand, and the
 * policy editor's third copy, made from `Button`, drifted. One primitive keeps
 * the three rails the same rail — which is why the pill look, when Settings
 * moved to it, moved all three at once rather than Settings alone. The rail
 * container is expected to pad its entries (`p-2`), since a rounded pill
 * running into the rail's edge reads as clipped.
 *
 * The active state is `brand`, not `primary`: `--primary` is near-white on a
 * dark theme and near-black on a light one (gotcha #60), which is how the old
 * 2px edge read as a grey line rather than as "you are here".
