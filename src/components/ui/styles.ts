 * Class fragments shared between the primitives in this directory.
 *
 * Strings and lookups only — no `cva`, no JSX, no React. Each primitive keeps
 * its own `cva` call in its own file; a second variant system living here would
 * be exactly the kind of divergence this file exists to end.
 *
 * Admission rule, deliberately strict: a fragment belongs here only if it has
 * **two or more consumers inside `ui/`** *and* encodes a decision somebody
 * made, rather than a typographic coincidence. That is why nothing speculative
 * is exported — `MICRO_HEADING` and the row-hover reveal arrive with the
 * primitives that consume them, following the norm `segmented.tsx` records
 * (create on first adoption, never in advance).
 *
 * Two things are deliberately NOT extracted, because extracting them would
 * erase a decision rather than share one:
 *
 * - `min-w-*` is not part of `MENU_PANEL`. A context menu is denser than a menu
 *   bar dropdown (`10rem` vs `8rem`), and that gap is intentional.
 * - Type scale is not part of `MENU_ITEM` / `MENU_SUBTRIGGER`. The dropdown is
 *   `text-sm` and the context menu `text-xs`, same reason.

 * The field focus language: the border itself turns brand blue and a soft 3px

 * on a 28px-tall field.
 *
 * Three entries rather than one interpolated template because the same visual
 * language hangs off three different pseudo-classes: `focus-visible` for a real
 * `<input>`, `focus` for Radix's `SelectTrigger` (a `<button>`, which never
 * receives `focus-visible` from a click), and `focus-within` for a wrapper div
 * around an input (`connection/TreeFilterBox.tsx`).
 *
 * DO NOT collapse these into `` `${on}:border-brand` ``. Tailwind's JIT scans
 * source files as *text*: a class assembled at runtime never appears in the
 * scan, so the CSS is never generated and the focus treatment silently vanishes
 * — no build error, no failing test, just a field that stops highlighting. Each
 * variant has to be written out literally somewhere, and here is that somewhere.
