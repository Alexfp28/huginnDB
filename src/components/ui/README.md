# `components/ui/` — the primitive layer

Presentational primitives. Everything here is reusable across every domain in
the app, carries no copy of its own, and can be rendered in a test without a
store, a mock, or an IPC boundary.

## The dependency rule

This is the frontier that keeps the layer reusable, and it is the one rule here
a test enforces (`uiContracts.test.ts`) rather than trusting to discipline.

| Layer           | May import                                                                                           | Must not import                                         |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ui/`           | `react`, `@radix-ui/*`, `lucide-react`, `class-variance-authority`, `@/lib/utils` (`cn`), `./styles` | `@/stores/*`, `@/lib/tauri`, `react-i18next`, `@/types` |
| `common/`       | all of the above, plus `react-i18next`, `@/types`, pure `@/lib/*`                                    | `@/lib/tauri`, `@/stores/*`                             |
| a domain folder | anything                                                                                             | —                                                       |

It gives an objective answer to the question that used to be settled by feel:

- **A primitive that needs its own words belongs in `common/`, not here.**
  `ConfirmDialog` (`t("common.cancel")`) and `PasswordInput` (the show/hide
  toggle's `aria-label`) both live there for exactly this reason. A shared
  component that takes its labels as props stays here.
- **A component that does IO belongs in its domain.** `FkCombobox` sat here for
  a long time while importing `@/lib/tauri` and a grid store — 375 lines, a
  quarter of the directory, that no other domain could ever use. It is
  `grid/FkCombobox.tsx` now.
- **No primitive reads a store.** This also neuters gotcha #1 (unstable Zustand
  selectors) by construction: a selector bug inside a primitive would arrive in
  a hundred call sites at once. There is exactly one real temptation — making
  the tooltip delay a preference — and the answer is to pass `delayDuration` to
  the `TooltipProvider` at each of the three window roots, which are components
  that already reach stores. See the note in `tooltip.tsx`.

## Conventions

- `React.forwardRef` for anything wrapping a DOM element, with
  `React.ElementRef<typeof X>` / `ComponentPropsWithoutRef<typeof X>` and the
  `displayName` inherited from the Radix primitive.
- `...props` always spread. A primitive with a closed prop list cannot be a
  tooltip target or an `asChild` slot.
- **`className` is always the last argument to `cn`**, so `tailwind-merge` lets
  the consumer win. `uiContracts.test.ts` asserts the behaviour rather than the
  spelling.
- **The size prop is `size`.** Where the native HTML attribute collides (`input`,
  `select`), `Omit` it from the props type — do not rename the prop.
- **Density vocabulary is `xs` / `sm` / `md`**: `h-7 text-xs` / `h-8 text-xs` /
  `h-9 text-sm`. `size="icon"` is a _shape_, not a density.
- **`brand` is the action colour, `primary` is not.** `--primary` is near-black
  in light themes and near-white in dark ones; `--brand` is the app's one
  saturated colour. Checkboxes, links and active states take `brand`.
- Repeated class fragments live in `styles.ts`, which takes only fragments with
  two or more consumers _in this directory_. New shared chrome is created on
  first adoption, never speculatively.

## Where behaviour is decided

This directory answers "what does a control look like". It deliberately does not
answer "what does the app _say_ when something is happening" — that spans
primitives, stores and domain components at once, so it lives in `CONTRIBUTING.md`
under **Feedback and transition state**: how an async transition is modelled,
when a control reads as destructive, who owns the busy state, and which writes
get confirmed. Read it before adding a `loading`, a `tone="destructive"`, or a
new spinner; each of those rules exists because the decision had already been
made somewhere else in the app and was re-made differently.

## Contracts vs. budgets

Two test files guard this layer and they answer different questions.

`uiContracts.test.ts` holds **contracts**: a violation is a bug, every allowlist
is empty, and that emptiness is its stated admission rule — a rule needing
exceptions is a matter of taste and does not belong there.

`uiAdoption.test.ts` holds **budgets**: a per-file count of a pattern a
primitive already replaces, seeded with today's real number and asserted
exactly, so debt cannot grow and a cleanup has to come and lower the number.
Today it counts 140 raw `<button>` elements and 81 native `title=` attributes
outside this directory. The failure output is the delta, so it names the file
and the transition (`"…/StatusBar.tsx": "5 -> 6"`) rather than diffing two
seventy-key objects.

The two are not in tension: a budget exists precisely for a rule that _cannot_
be a contract yet. When a budget empties, the rule graduates into
`uiContracts.test.ts` with an empty allowlist and leaves the ratchet; when both
have graduated, `uiAdoption.test.ts` is deleted.

`ui/` has no barrel `index.ts`, deliberately. Call sites import by path
(`@/components/ui/button`), which is what lets a file move inside this directory
without touching its own imports — the invariant gotcha #28 asks to keep. A
barrel would also add a second import path to diverge, for no gain across the
200-plus `Button` call sites.
