/**
 * How hard the model should think, as a detent switch.
 *
 * # The design brief, and why it is a slider rather than a select
 *
 * `reasoning_effort` is an *ordered* quantity with a real trade-off at each end
 * — faster against smarter — and a dropdown states none of that. It shows six
 * words of equal weight and makes the user work out that "low" is cheaper than
 * "high" and that "auto" is not on the same axis at all. A track with discrete
 * stops carries the ordering, the direction and the current position in one
 * glance, which is the whole job.
 *
 * The register is the app's, not a new one: the dark panel chrome, `--brand` as
 * the single accent, the `xs` density, mono for the value. A control that
 * introduced its own typeface or palette inside a 360px dock panel would read
 * as a widget bolted on rather than part of the tool — and `components/ui/`'s
 * rules (gotcha #60) exist precisely to stop that. What is spent here is
 * precision: the fill and the knob share one easing, the stops light up in
 * order, and the trigger carries a five-bar meter so the level is legible
 * without opening anything.
 *
 * # Accessibility comes from a native control, not from ARIA
 *
 * The visible track, stops and knob are `pointer-events-none` decoration. The
 * thing that actually handles a drag, a click, Home/End and the arrow keys is
 * an ordinary `<input type="range">` lying transparent on top of them, which
 * also supplies the role, the value and the value text for free. Hand-rolling
 * that on a `<div role="slider">` is how a control ends up keyboard-hostile,
 * and the app has no Radix slider dependency to reach for.
 *
 * # Why `auto` is a switch and not the leftmost stop
 *
 * Because it is not a lower effort — it means *send no `reasoning_effort` at
 * all*, which is the only setting a strict server (OpenAI on a non-reasoning
 * model) cannot reject. Putting it on the track would imply an ordering it does
 * not have and would hide the one thing about it worth knowing. See
 * `AiReasoningEffort` in `src-tauri/src/prefs.rs`.
