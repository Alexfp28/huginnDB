/**
 * A statement the assistant proposed, in a read-only Monaco with a per-statement
 * lens that opens it in a query tab.
 *
 * # Why the lens opens the editor instead of running here
 *
 * Roadmap decision D4, read literally: *"any mutation is emitted as SQL in a
 * Monaco block the user runs themselves with the existing per-statement ▶ Run
 * CodeLens"* — the *editor's* lens. So this block's lens hands the statement to
 * `openQueryTab` and stops there. Three reasons it is the right seam and not a
 * shortcut:
 *
 * - **The result needs somewhere to go.** This panel is 360px wide and has no
 *   grid, no pager and no export. Running in place would mean building a second
 *   result surface nobody asked for.
 * - **Every guard already lives in the editor.** The destructive-statement
 *   confirmation, the unfiltered-write refusal, the Console entry, the history
 *   record, the ability to edit and rerun.
 * - **A write should be seen before it runs.** Landing the user in the editor
 *   with the statement in front of them is the whole posture D4 exists to keep.
 *
 * # Why Monaco and not a `<pre>`
 *
 * Decision D5: Monaco is already self-hosted here, and it gives SQL colouring,
 * selection and the lens gutter for free. The providers it needs are **global
 * to the language** and installed once (`ensureSqlProviders`); this component
 * registers only its own model's data in the shared registry, which is the
 * pattern gotcha #9 and gotcha #57 both exist to enforce — a
 * `registerCodeLensProvider` per block would put one duplicate lens on every
 * statement for every block on screen.
