# HuginnDB MCP connector

Lets an AI client inspect and query the databases you have saved in the
[HuginnDB](https://github.com/Alexfp28/huginnDB) desktop app — PostgreSQL,
MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB and Microsoft SQL Server — with a per-connection write
policy that is read-only by default.

## Requirements

The HuginnDB desktop app must be installed on the same machine. This extension
reads its saved connection profiles and the matching passwords from the OS
keychain; it has no connection settings of its own.

## Setup

1. Install this extension.
2. In HuginnDB, open **Settings → MCP** and tick the connections you want the
   assistant to reach. Nothing is reachable until you do.
3. Give each of them a write level if you want more than reads: `read-only`
   (default), `data` (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) or `full` (also schema changes).

Both are re-read on every call, so ticking a connection or raising its level
takes effect without restarting the AI client.

## What it can do

Read schema, browse rows, run read-only statements, and read server health
(queries/s, slowest statements, index usage, open sessions). Writing is a
separate set of tools, each refused unless the connection's policy allows it,
and every write is recorded in `mcp-audit.log` next to your profiles.

## Privacy Policy

**Everything stays on your machine.** This extension has no server, no account
and no telemetry.

- **What it collects:** nothing. No usage data, no analytics, no crash reports
  are sent anywhere.
- **What it reads:** the connection profiles saved by the HuginnDB desktop app
  (host, port, database, username) and the matching passwords from your
  operating system's keychain, at the moment it opens a connection. It reads
  only the connections you have exposed in Settings → MCP.
- **What it stores:** a local audit log of write operations (`mcp-audit.log`,
  in HuginnDB's own configuration directory), holding the statement and the
  number of rows affected. Never credentials.
- **Who it shares with:** nobody. Database results are returned to the MCP
  client that asked for them — the AI application running on your machine —
  and to nothing else. What that application then does with them is governed
  by *its* privacy policy.
- **Retention:** the audit log stays on your disk until you delete it. Nothing
  else is retained.
- **Contact:** <contact@shion.es>, or
  [open an issue](https://github.com/Alexfp28/huginnDB/issues).
