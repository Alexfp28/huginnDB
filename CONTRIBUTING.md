# Contributing to HuginnDB

Thanks for taking the time to contribute. HuginnDB is a young project; clear, well-scoped contributions are the fastest way to get changes shipped.

## Ground rules

- **Be respectful.** Treat the issue tracker and PR reviews as professional spaces. We have no patience for hostility.
- **One change per PR.** A bug fix, a feature, or a refactor — pick one. PRs that mix concerns will be sent back for a split.
- **Keep PRs small.** Reviews are easier and merges are faster when the diff fits on a screen.
- **No drive-by reformatting.** If you reformat existing code, do it in a separate commit (and ideally a separate PR).

## Filing issues

Before opening an issue:

1. Search [existing issues](https://github.com/Alexfp28/huginnDB/issues) to avoid duplicates.
2. Reproduce on the latest `main`.
3. Include: OS, Rust toolchain version (`rustc -V`), Node version (`node -v`), pnpm version, the database engine and version you were targeting, and the smallest sequence of steps that reproduces the problem.

Bug reports without reproductions will be triaged last.

## Setting up a dev environment

See the [README](README.md#prerequisites) for the full list. The short version:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm tauri:dev
```

That launches the Tauri shell with HMR for the React frontend and `cargo` rebuilds for the Rust backend.

When in doubt, read `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` and `src/App.tsx` first — they're the entry points and reference the rest of the codebase.

## Coding standards

### Rust

- Use `rustfmt` defaults: `cargo fmt --all` before pushing.
- `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` should pass.
- Public items get a Rustdoc comment. Internal helpers don't have to, unless their behaviour is non-obvious.
- Never `unwrap()` outside of tests or `build.rs`. Use `?` with `AppError` instead.
- Errors that cross the FFI boundary go through `AppError`; do not return ad-hoc strings.

### TypeScript / React

- Run `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm test` before pushing — CI runs both.
- Tests are Vitest, colocated as `*.test.ts(x)`. There is no blanket suite: the
  convention is a characterization test for anything pure or hook-shaped you
  extract, written before the extraction so it pins the current behaviour.
  `pnpm test:watch` while you work.
- Stores live in `src/stores/`, command wrappers in `src/lib/tauri.ts`. Components never call `invoke` directly.
- Zustand selectors must return reference-stable values. If you need a derived array/object, subscribe to the raw state and memoise in the component. See the warning at the bottom of `src/stores/preferences/theme.ts` for the historical reason.
- The component library is `src/components/ui/`, and it has a rule: those files may import `react`, Radix, lucide, `cva` and `cn` — never a store, `@/lib/tauri`, `react-i18next` or `@/types`. A shared component that carries its own copy belongs in `common/`; one that does IO belongs in its domain folder. `src/components/ui/README.md` has the table, and `uiContracts.test.ts` enforces it.
- Density is one vocabulary across primitives: a `size` of `xs`/`sm`/`md` (`h-7`/`h-8`/`h-9`). Where the native HTML `size` attribute collides, `Omit` it from the props type rather than renaming the prop.
- `brand` is the colour of an action; `primary` is not (it is near-black in light themes). Checkboxes, links and active states take `brand`.
- Repeated class fragments live in `src/components/ui/styles.ts`, which only takes fragments with two or more consumers inside that directory. **Never assemble a Tailwind class at runtime** — the JIT scans source as text, so an interpolated class produces no CSS and fails silently.
- A new primitive is created on first adoption, never speculatively, and arrives with its own `*.test.tsx`. Note that `cva` does not merge classes: assert "the consumer's `className` wins" against rendered output, not against the variant function's return value.
- Avoid CDN-loaded assets. Anything needed at runtime must be bundled (Monaco is the canonical example — see `src/lib/monaco/monaco-setup.ts`).

### Feedback and transition state

Four decisions the app kept re-making, differently, until each cost a bug. They
are behavioural rather than visual, which is why they are not in the list above
and why three of the four look like styling problems while having nothing to do
with styling. Each is stated with the question that decides whether it applies —
a rule you apply everywhere is as wrong as one nobody applies.

**An async transition names its subject, not a flag.** *Does the operation act
on one of several things the user can see at once?* Then the state holds which
one — `switchingTo: string | null`, `connecting: string | null`,
`disconnecting: Set<string>` — and the boolean is derived at the point of use.
A single-subject operation (a dialog submitting) is a boolean, and that is fine.
The trap is that the "current" pointer usually does not move until the operation
*ends*: `switchTo` flushes the outgoing session and closes every one of its
pools before `activeId` changes, so `switching && isActive` parked the spinner
on the environment being left for the whole of the slow part. No styling fixes
that — the state could not express where you were going. Read the field as a
primitive and derive; a selector returning a fresh object re-renders every
consumer.

**Destructive intent shows on hover; confirmation is a separate tier.** *Would
someone regret this click?* Then the control is muted at rest and destructive on
hover (`IconButton`'s `tone="destructive"`). Red at rest turns a panel into a
warning nobody reads; no red at all is how "disconnect all" — which drops every
live pool in the tree — came to look exactly like the filter button beside it.
Whether it also needs a *confirmation* is a different question with three
answers, not one. `confirmDestructive` is gated on the user's preference and is
for things they could redo — a row they can re-insert, a table they can
repopulate. `confirmIrreversible` ignores that preference and is for anything
that exists nowhere else: an environment's tabs and layout, an origin's stored
passphrase, interrupting someone else's live AI session. And a destructive
action that has to explain *why* it failed uses `ConfirmDialog`, whose `error`
slot keeps the dialog open — a toast is the wrong surface for that. The
preference was never a blanket "never ask me anything", and reading it as one
turns one stale toggle into silent data loss.

**Busy belongs to the control.** *Can this be a round trip?* Then pass `loading`
to `Button` / `IconButton` rather than swapping in a `Spinner` by hand — it
disables the control at the same time, which the hand-rolled version usually
forgets. Closing a pool through a tunnel or a pooler is a round trip *per
database*, so "instant" is not a safe assumption anywhere a connection is
involved. In a dialog use `useAsyncSubmit`, and note that its refusal to clear
the flag on success is deliberate: the success path closes or replaces the
dialog, so clearing first re-enables the buttons for the frames before the
unmount lands.

**Confirm a write only when its effect is not self-evident.** *Would the screen
look identical whether this succeeded or not?* A delete removes the row and an
insert adds one — the result is the confirmation, and a flash on top is noise.
An in-place update is the case that needs one, because the new value was on
screen while you typed it and nothing distinguishes "stored" from "typed"; the
grid had no confirmation at all, so silence had to be read as success. Use
`animate-brand-flash`, one shot, on the thing that changed, and fire it **after
the result has landed** — every save path refetches, so the pulse then confirms
the stored value rather than the keystrokes, and a rejected write throws before
it can ever look like a success.

**Where the decision goes matters as much as the decision.** All four are easy
to apply at a call site and wrong to leave there. The grid fires a save from
twelve places across six files; the confirmation is one wrapper around the two
callbacks in `DataGrid`, before they are handed down, so every existing path and
any added later confirms itself without knowing the rule exists. Twelve
decorations would have been twelve chances to forget — which is exactly how the
app came to have no confirmation anywhere. Prefer the seam.

### Commits

We use a lightweight [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) style:

```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>

<long description with context and rationale>
```

Types we use: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `chore`, `perf`, `test`.

Examples:

- `feat(query): add Ctrl+Shift+Enter to run only the selected SQL`
- `fix(theme): avoid infinite re-render when selector returned a new array`
- `refactor(backend): centralise keychain access in src-tauri/src/keychain.rs`

Long-form messages are expected for non-trivial changes. Explain *why* the change is needed, not just what it does — the diff already shows the latter.

## Pull requests

- Branch off the latest `main`.
- Open a PR with a meaningful title (same convention as commits).
- Fill in the PR description: what it does, why, how it was tested, and any screenshots for UI changes.
- Mark the PR as draft if it's not ready for review.
- At least one approval is required before merging.

## Adding a new database driver

Adding a sixth driver (ClickHouse, DuckDB, etc.) touches:

1. `Cargo.toml` — the driver crate. **Not necessarily a `sqlx` feature**: `sqlx`
   0.8 covers Postgres/MySQL/SQLite only, so MongoDB (`mongodb`) and SQL Server
   (`tiberius`) each bring their own client — and, in SQL Server's case, its own
   connection pool, since `tiberius` has none. Discuss the dependency first
   (see the small-tree preference in `CLAUDE.md`).
2. `src-tauri/src/state.rs` — extend the `Driver` and `DbPool` enums, plus
   `Driver::wire_name`. Any driver-specific connection settings go in a nested
   struct (`MsSqlOptions`-style), not as new top-level profile fields.
3. `src-tauri/src/db/sql.rs` — add a `Dialect` variant. This is where identifier
   quoting, placeholders, the text cast, `LIKE` semantics and pagination live;
   getting it right here means most of the command layer needs no per-driver
   code at all.
4. `src-tauri/src/db/pool.rs` — connection construction (URL builder for a
   `sqlx` driver, or an early return into your own module otherwise) +
   `smoke_test`, and `src-tauri/src/keepalive.rs` — the liveness ping.
5. Row → JSON decoding: `src-tauri/src/db/values.rs` for a `sqlx` driver, or a
   `values.rs` inside your own module (see `db/mssql/`, `db/mongo/`).
6. `src-tauri/src/commands/` — the compiler will point at every `match` on
   `DbPool` that needs an arm: `schema.rs` (introspection), `query.rs`
   (execute/browse/count/insert/update/delete/FK lookups), `bulk.rs`,
   `structure.rs`, `view.rs`, `dump.rs`, `connection.rs`. Watch for arms that
   are *not* exhaustive-checked; a `_ =>` here silently routes a new driver
   down another engine's path.
7. DDL, if you implement it: `src-tauri/src/db/ddl.rs`, `db/view_ddl.rs` and
   `db/dump.rs`. All three are pure builders with unit tests — start there.
8. Frontend: `src/types.ts` (the `Driver` union), `src/lib/constants.ts`
   (default port), `src/components/common/DriverBadge.tsx` + an SVG in
   `public/image/db/`, `src/lib/db/driver.ts` (CLI aliases + capability gates),
   `src/lib/db/columnTypes.ts`, `src/lib/sql/sqlKeywords.ts`,
   `src/components/connection/dialogs/ConnectionDialog.tsx` and
   `AdHocDriverDialog.tsx`, `src/components/settings/sections/GeneralSection.tsx`,
   and **both** i18n locales. `DriverBadge`'s `Record<Driver, …>` is the only
   thing that fails to compile; the rest are hardcoded lists `tsc` can't see.

Open an issue first if you're planning this so we can agree on the scope.
